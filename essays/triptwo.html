                <p>Hudson: “We should make a treasure map.”

                <p>The first two members of Team Dumbass arrived in New York with time to spare early afternoon, with the intent to drive through the night to get to Nashville. We had to pick up Julia and Heather and David would follow in his car that night.</p>

                <p>Nashville was very welcoming with a cloudless sky, perfect temperature, and just like every other stop, we had no plans whatsoever. We decided to go to a lake and just be high. The lake was, if vacation could be used as an adjective, extremely vacation. It was big but not so large you couldn’t see the other side, there was nobody else except for two children and a lazy mother there, and watching the ducks go by was the perfect way to expel my body of the tiredness of driving for 12 hours straight. Nick and I penned the first song of our make believe EP, 90 Degrees to Infinity, a song entitled “Just High”.</p>

                <p>In each city we stopped on our road trip, there is always street where everything happens. By everything I mean the general culture of that city, where the majority of its residents go there to find entertainment, and the de facto place where things happen. For Nashville it happened to be Broadway.</p>

                <p>To see the culture of a random city, a bar is a nice place to start. The first bar that attracted us so was called Rippy’s, literally the first bar past the Bridgestone Arena. Music was in the air and that was all that was needed. A fairly empty place, the only patrons in the bar were all sitting down at tables and the bar was strangely empty. The stage was immediately visible and “Me and Bobby McGee” was the song we walked in on, very fitting. The stage was very window-y in that there was lots of open air and very much free for passerby to walk by, listen for a bit and then keep walking. A young girl from the crowd just randomly decided to start singing with the band, got on stage, with a sequined hat and cowboy boots and laid down the “Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy” song and that was that. It seemed as if the band was a family, the first singer was a older woman, the lead guitarist her loving husband, the bassist and drummer were uncles, and the grandfather was sitting in a wheelchair playing the slide guitar. In truth, it seemed as if the entire city was one big family, from the way people treated each other.</p>

                <p>The next day we left Nashville for Memphis, and with David all caught up, we decided to camp at a random lake halfway to Memphis. Turns out camping next to a lake in the South is like the worst thing ever if you don’t like mosquitos. In OKCupid, one the questions I was asked upon making a profile was “If you could eradicate mosquitoes, would you?” and my answer then and still is a resounding yes.</p>
