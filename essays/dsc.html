                <p>An institution whose past was once shrouded in mystery, the former Duke Sauna Club was a place where friends met and brothers bonded. Started unofficially by Brendan Szulik and Amol Sura back in 2008, the sauna at Wilson was frequented on and off as friends until its revival in 2010. Along with Christopher Walker and Zach Corse, three life-long friends of the Marine Lab, we made Duke Sauna Club a custom. Tuesday’s @ 9, bring your towel and your red Powerade. <br>
<br>
                After an unforgettable summer at the Marine Lab, the three of us needed a regular gathering time to take off our shirts like we used to. We all had separate living situations, as well as different classes so it was easy for one thing to lead to another such that we could never find the time together to talk life. We started using the sauna in Wilson Gym as our outlet. It was private and novel. Being naked with your friends is the perfect metaphor for dropping your guard on all the stresses of senior year college. <br>
<br>
                As we started going regularly, our forum started taking form. We would run cycles of time in the sauna, and taking ice-cold showers directly outside, repeating this 3-4 times per session, or until our Powerades ran out. We three became sauna pros. Being competitive friends, nobody wanted to be the one to tap out for a cycle, initiating the cold shower, so we set up a system, and organizational structure for the DSC.<br>
<br>
                The sauna at Wilson was set up such that there were two rows of seats, one higher than the other. The higher row of seats are marked 1-4, while the lower ones are 5-8. The Source was the heater, which had a ladle that you could use to pour water on the coals, which made the temperature rise. The door was across from the seats and if you opened the door, the temperature would drop significantly, so opening and closing the door/being indecisive was frowned upon.<br>
                <img src="/img/dsc/DSC.png" class="mainimg">
                <br><br>The seats are as follows:<br>
<br>
                1: King Seat<br>
                This seat was the first to gain a name, and the most important of all. The person sitting in the king seat can never voluntarily call to leave the sauna for a break, that can only be done by his friends sitting next to him. It was known as the king seat because it is the hottest seat. The temperature difference between sitting on the upper rows vs the lower ones was significant and the king seat was the closest of the the upper deck to the source. There has to be a person sitting in king seat always. It was bad for conversation because you had a wall to your left. It was pretty much sit there and endure.<br>
<br>
                2. Right-hand man<br>
                Prime position for conversation, as well as a good view as to what is going on outside. The door was glass, so you could see what was going on outside, but the king seat was angled such that you really couldn’t.<br>
<br>
                3. Third base<br>
                Underappreciated in baseball and DSC alike, a great all-around seat for conversation, with a nice mix of heat.<br>
<br>
                4. The Jester<br>
                Farthest away from the heat, yet still on the upper deck, and no direct contact with the king seat. A prankster’s place.<br>
<br>
                5. The Scientist<br>
                Closest to the ladle, and thus responsible for pouring water onto the coals, which produced an immensely hot steam. <br>
<br>
                6. Untitled<br>
                We were supposed to come back to this one later.<br>
<br>
                7. Guardian<br>
                Direct view of outside, and low heat. Responsible for guarding the rest of the sauna so they can enjoy. Not a seat for conversation.<br>
<br>
                8. Bitch Seat<br>
                The seat with the worst heat, being on the lower deck, and farthest away from the source.<br>
<br>
                Misc: <br>
                Dugout<br>
                This place was for when the sauna was full or if you needed a break but didn’t want to open the door for your fellow DSC. You could sit here, and it would be lower than the lower deck, and also the source so it was relatively easy to stay here for a while.<br>
<br>
                The DSC soon became a regular fixture in our schedules, although circumstances sometimes intervened. We would talk about school, girls, goals, ideas and then finish off with a nice “mirror sesh” in the locker room. I used the DSC as the blueprint for a pledging event, calling it the SAEauna, harassing pledges for answers to stupid questions while denying them water. It was a place where I could go to enjoy simple friendship.<br>
<br>
                After I graduated Duke, I would still go and sauna alone from time to time, depending on if I had a gym to go to, but its obviously never the same. The people and the oddity will be forever gone but we had a good go.</p>
