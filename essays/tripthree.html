                <p>We drove into Memphis, settled down, did all the boring stuff that doesn’t need to be in a memoir, and made for the river. Memphis downtown and near the river was clean, welcoming and was the kind of city that could keep anyone in good spirits. There were horse-drawn carriages that one could take in lieu of taxis, trees along every street I could remember, and there was no real traffic to speak of. It was the first city that I’ve seen where downtown parking is easy.</p> 
                <img class="mainimg" src="/img/trip/pyramids.jpg">
                <p>It appeared to me that the entire city could have been an outdoor mall, with shops lining the sidewalks, fountains and outdoor restaurants everywhere you can see. You could play lava on the wide sidewalks, there was enough of a mix between chains and local shops, there were back alleys, but they were wide and clean as well. Everything had space.</p>
                <p>We made our way around while the girls decided to do something called a Zombie Walk, where everyone puts on makeup, ragged clothes and shoves a few axes into their forehead and plays the part of a zombie apocalypse walking through town. People take pride in their zombie parade and there were hipsters sporting zombie walk 2002 shirts to prove it. We watched zombies lurch and stumble and drag themselves on by for a good hour. There was a wide variety of turnout, from 2nd grade classes and redneck families to beauties that could’ve been in the VS fashion show and your normal zombie hand holding couple.</p>
                <img class="mainimg" src="/img/trip/brains.jpg">
                <p>The zombie walk landed us on Beale Street, which like Nashville’s Broadway before it, was Memphis’s “happening street.” Memphis is known to be the heart of the blues, and Beale St. did not disappoint. starting with the B.B. King’s Blues Club, Beale goes on for four blocks of bars, clubs and places to get into trouble. The entire street is closed off the entire time, meaning that even though it was a paved road, cars aren’t allowed at night ever, and at the entrance itself there is a line that takes thirty minutes. And everywhere, there are lights, flashing lights, rotating and swiveling around to vie for your attention, and sounds to go with it all, electric guitars and basses jamming out, trumpets and saxes trying to out do each other and drum kits going wild. There was live music everywhere, not cover bands like in Nashville, and everyone in these bands were old. It looked as if they had been playing for years, and the music they played reflected that as much. The Memphis blues don’t stress velocity or speed, high notes and flashy riffs, but more slow and fashioning sounds.</p>
                <img class="mainimg" src="/img/trip/bluesing.jpg">
                <p>Our night ended with the blues and with us sleeping in a hotel as we were all a bit too tired to do anything otherwise. The next morning we got up to eat at the Four-Way restaurant, a place where MLK used to frequent. The shop owner explained the meaning of soul food, food that had the power to heal your soul. After lunch, Nick and I wanted to do the mushrooms we brought with us and David, Julia and Heather wanted to reach New Orleans sooner so we split up for the day.</p>
                <img class="mainimg" src="/img/trip/fourway.jpg">
                <p>We parked our car in a parking garage, and in the then sweltering heat, started eating the mushrooms. I can tell you that they taste most foul and it had not been for a nice full bottle of water, the mushrooms would not have gone down. They taste the way that food tastes when you immediately get off a plane or a boat, your mouth and tongue don’t want anything to do with food, your mouth is salivating intensely and you keep swallowing so as to not throw up everywhere, but at the same time, you are forcing down mushrooms and chewing them. By the end, my stomach was churning something horrid and could not even stand. I sat down with my back leaning against my car trying to decide if I needed to puke, and if so, was it worth it to try and stand up to find a bathroom. Nick found some strength that I couldn’t and walked away to find a bathroom to shit but I just couldn’t follow. My head was spinning, I had tried to drink water but I couldn’t even swallow without thinking I was going to puke. My white shorts and shirt had gotten immensely dirty from my rolling on the floor of a parking garage, and I was spitting every ten seconds like I was coming down from some poison. Mushrooms usually don’t induce this kind of response, but our mushrooms had not seen a fridge for a week and on top of that, had been in a hot car; a combination for any stomach to fear. Slowly, the line between nausea and euphoria became a bit clearer and I had passed into the high that I was promised.</p>
                <p>And so, I sat on the floor of the parking garage, stomach churning, head spinning, heart pounding, legs shaking ever so slightly, and slowly yet suddenly realized I couldn’t hold a thought. My thoughts flowed through time and so was my vision. Looking at the markings in the cement, and the way they flowed into each other, I felt like my sight was going through time, seeing how these markings would spin and weave together. It was as if before, my entire life, I was looking at each instance of light and vision independently, as if each were a slice of a sphere, such that I was only seeing a circle at a time, and now, I was seeing the entire sphere in its entirety. Everything to see had always been there before, but I just had never put it all together. And it was beautiful.
                We walked to a park by the river to lay down and enjoy our newfound lens for life. I like to think of myself as someone who always has a grip on my life, or least can put off the illusion as to, but truly I had no idea what the fuck was going on. Grass never felt so warm, laughing never felt so good, and whenever I tried to make a connection between two seemingly unrelated things, the link was always there. I could draw connections and meaning from just about anything I thought of, whether it be the clouds in the sky, the movement in the trees, to the clothes I wore and to my name. I could have stayed there for as long as I wanted, but Nick, being an experienced tripper, wanted to be moving. We’d learn more as we walked, he had said, so we set out to go by the river.</p>
                <img class="mainimg" src="/img/trip/fadedswirl.jpg">
                <p>The river was hot and sunny and the sun was high on the sky, high noon style and we were watching the water flow by when a shout came from up the hill. The river was in a valley of sorts, and you had to walk to in by stepping on cinder blocks so that your feet didn’t sink into the mud, and this guy was just skipping all the cinder blocks and tripping all over myself. He was wearing a huge orange t-shirt, much larger them himself, shorts that said the same, and kept shouting as he came down to where we were. “AYY! You kids 21??” He yelled. “YEAH!” we replied. His name was CJ, a singer-songwriter from Tenneessee.. Three dirty homeless guys and an Icehouse.</p>
                <p>CJ was unstable, that was the first thing I remembered. We were commenting on the river when he got up immediately and just jumped in. Not to say this is unusual, but this guy was full of surprises. The river up close looked basically like it gotten dredged every other year and still had lingering effects from back when people didn’t care what got put into the river. He ran quite a bit out into the river, and whilst wading through the water looked like Forrest Gump at the capitol, albeit much muddier. He fell multiple times and sometimes seemed like he was drowning, which surprisingly didn’t panic me.</p>
                <p>He had shared his Icehouse and now I guess he expected us to share his weed and our guitar. So we did; he turned out to be horrible at guitar. He tried to sing to this girl of 14 or so, or rather her family, but I didn’t think CJ could see them. They immediately got up and left, although the grandma seemed interested.</p>
                <p>We walked along the river watching a pilot fly his little Cessna freely. He would go straight up in the air, stall his plane, and then tumble back down and just before it looked like he would do a CJ and go into the river, he’d pull it back up, sometimes with less then 50-100 ft to spare. Crazy stuff. He did loop-the-loops like nothing and seemed almost magical the way the pilot could control flight. We then went to the park along the river, which there was a massive gathering of people, all there for an event called the Sunset Symphony. We, being completely irresponsible, did not think to buy tickets but when we explained our situation, which was completely contrived, one of the ticket girls just gave us her spare all-access pass. I still have a crush on her to this day.</p>
                <img class="mainimg" src="/img/trip/sunsetsymphony.jpg">
                <p>We had promised our others that we’d get to N’awlins that night and our plan was to drive through the night to get there. But as we were wandering back to the car, we started tripping through a bridge that had these psychedelic lights that lighted up the path as you went across it, using some kind of motion sensors/magic combination. Pictures just don’t do this thing justice, especially at night, this thing is like the first time you put two legos together. Parts of your brain are just happy to walk across this thing.</p>
