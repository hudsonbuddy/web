                <p>After Austin, we drove through Tornado Alley and saw some cool weather on our way through Amarillo and into Denver to meet up with the final character in this play, Joo-Young. We didn’t spend too much time in Denver, although I do remember that the weather was incredibly nice and everything was clean. We ate at a BD’s Mongolian BBQ and it was delicious. We drove up to Yellowstone the next day to camp.<br>

                 J (on the possible dimensions): The fourth is time, the fifth is an alternate existence that this world could possibly have, the sixth is all of this world’s possible alternate existences, the seventh is all these possible worlds that could have existed with a different beginnings, the eighth contains in a point the complete histories of the seventh’s worlds, the ninth alters these histories with all the different possible mutations of physical laws, and the tenth contains the ninth’s inexhaustible imagination in a point.<br>
                 H: I don’t think there is a god particle underneath anything. I think it keeps going. If infinity holds true for anything in the universe, then it has to hold true for everything. If you limit one thing, everything else falls apart.<br>
                 J: We’ve already limited everything to the speed of light. If time isn’t moving, then you can’t get past it. You can’t just continue to break energy down.<br>
                 H: The point is it never ends.<br>
                 J: The tenth dimension doesn’t have to end…But matter is a fine line Hudson. You are made of matter.<br>
                 H: But what is matter made out of?<br>
                 J: No Hudson. We’re going to find the smallest particle and identify it.<br>
                 H: And then in a hundred years we’re gonna be like, oh shit…Every particle before it we have.<br>

                 H: What would you do with a helicopter?<br>
                 J: When was the last time you saw a helipad?<br>
                 N: What if when you leave your room your toys come to life?<br>
                 J: Why don’t they move? Because they don’t have muscles.<br>
                 H: Exactly. It’s the Toy Story argument. That should be your patent argument style, Nick. Anything is possible.<br>
                 J: That’s a very bad argument. Your theory is used by all religion. You can’t disprove what you can’t see.<br>
                 H: I guess it’s been around for a long time.<br>
                 J: So Hudson do you believe in Mormonism?<br>
                 H: Yeah.<br>
                 J: Do you believe in Scientology?<br>
                 H: Yeah.<br>
                 J: So you believe that something that looked like a Boeing 737 flew from the state, dropped our soldiers in a volcano, which multiple soldiers came out of, and that’s how we made human beings?<br>
                 N: What?<br>
                 H: Yeah, the way you told that story, it sounded fine. I’m saying it’s a possibility. I’m not saying that’s what really happened. Oh shit look, a 747! Yo are we gonna talk about this while we’re on acid?<br>

                 N: JOC on that LSD- yo let’s go to the Albany County Fairgrounds!<br>
                 H: Do not get pulled over. We will all go to jail if we get pulled over.<br>
                 J: I’m only going five over the speed limit.<br>
                 H: You have out of state plates.<br>
                 J: You know it’s a lot of work to pull someone over, right?<br>
                 …<br>
                 J: You don’t win if you start a world war. Everyone loses.<br>

                 At Yellowstone, the first night we camped in sub-zero weather and I felt like I was going to freeze. As soon as I got up, I went to the bathroom to heat up from the wind and to put my hands on the dryer. Showers and hot water there cost $10. We ate breakfast at their lodge and it was really warm. The food and environment was exactly a ski lodge. The workers were similar there too. We then drove to a different campsite and hiked Purple Mountain while tripping on the last of our acid.<br>

                 After coming down from Purple Mountain we touched down in civilization, known as Salt Lake City to see their famous dried up lake and all their birds and poop. People were taking wedding photos in the wind and it was beautiful to see. We continued on, moving from nature to man with a stop in Las Vegas. I had never been there before, and I never knew how fake everything was, although in a good way. Paris, Venice, NYC, ancient Rome and Egypt all make appearances, and even the sky is painted blue. It was very walkable and we spent most of our money at cheap places, especially this one place called Bill’s, which also is coincidentally closed now. We played poker there and they had $5 blackjack and we just sat there and drank their free drinks. We wandered up and down the strip, doing the last of all of our drugs before going into California, as the trip was winding down. We ate the rest of our already-bad mushrooms, ecstasy and drank until we couldn’t stand up straight. The day we left Nick overdrew his bank account and gambled all of his money while Joo and I were sleeping and he comes back with double his money on a single hand of blackjack.<br>

                 We spent the last part of the road trip in the Grand Canyon, watching a sunrise and doing a hike, but it wasn’t that fun. We drove through to SF and I met up with David, and started working, concluding the road trip. We drove almost 6000 miles, taking a month, and however romantic it may seem, it actually was.
