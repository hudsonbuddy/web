    </p>
    <p class="dialog">Gladly. So I was looking through the police notes for this
    case, and I happened to run across a few suspicious occurrences. First, the
    door. It was obviously locked and then broken into, and quite violently too, I
    might add. The three people who work in this lab, Lacey, Cami and Gary, all
    have keys and thus would not bring attention to themselves by breaking this
    lock in the dead of night.<br>

    <p class="character">SHEEN<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">Incorrect. We would be arresting the wrong person if we
    continue. The second suspicious occurance is the janitor's story about our
    friend Drake here. Always hanging out, day and night outside of this room? They
    say a culprit always returns to the scene of the crime, and here have it folks.
    The person who stole the fair lady Lacey's award winning paper is none other
    than our slippery friend Drake here!<br>

    <p class="dialog">That's right. Only a person without the key, and without
    knowledge of where the paper would be could cause that mess on the door and
    that mess on the desk. If we are careful, I know we can find fingerprints
    somewhere, just admit to the crime now Drake, I'll see to it in court that you
    don't see too much jailtime.<br>

    <p class="dialog">I think I would tend to disagree.<br>

    </p>
    <p class="character">David<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">Fine. I was having such fun listening to your story too. I'll
    start from the top then. The first and most important piece of information is
    that of the janitor's. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">LACEY<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">The janitor's?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">DAVID<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">That's right. The janitor said that during his entire night
    shift, he only saw Drake, Gary and Cami here. That essentially puts an umbrella
    around these three, and only one of them could have stolen the paper. As to the
    times he saw them, he does not remember, he sees different people every night,
    I understand. Now if we look at each of these three, we see that our friend
    Gary here as the best motive and the worst alibi. Both Gary and Lacey have
    papers that might be in contention of undergraduate publication in Science and
    Nature magazine, a worthy prize for any up and coming researcher. Since Dreiser
    can only sponsor one article, removing the other paper from contention is the
    most surefire way. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">TOBEY<br>

    <p class="dialog">Well, there you have it. Gary, let's do this.<br>

    <p class="dialog">Get your hands off me, I told you already I didn't take it.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">DAVID<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">And I believe you. In my interaction with Gary, I see him as
    a competitive type, a hard worker and although not nice, an honest person. He
    is the type of person who would rather work harder on his own project than to
    sabotage another. He got here from nothing through hard work and he's proud of
    that. The due date for his draft is coming up and I think he came to the lab to
    put some finishing touches before his meeting with his advisor today.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">CAMI<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">Gary, why didn't you just say so?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">GARY<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">God damnit. I didn't want Lacey to know that I work on my
    project twice as hard as she does, and it still pales in comparison. It just
    comes to you so easily, Lacey, I've always admired that.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">LACEY<br>

    </p>
    <p class="character">DAVID<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">And that brings us to Drake. Oh Drake, what to do with you.
    Going on with my series of events that night. I believe that Gary came in to
    work, then left within the hour. That's when Drake made his move. The locks on
    these doors are not easily broken, it requires someone of above average
    strength and determination, perhaps a lacrosse player?<br>

    <p class="character">DAVID<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">Hold on Lacey, I haven't finished yet. I do think that Drake
    broke this lock, and fumbled around the desk and made it a mess. I agree with
    Sheen on this account.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="character">SHEEN<br>
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">Humph.</p>
    <p class="character">DAVID<br>
