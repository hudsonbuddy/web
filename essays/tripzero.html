                <p>On the 22nd day of May, 2012, <br><br>I packed my life and myself into my car, and started on the first of 6000 miles across the country. Along the way, I had all of my worldly possessions stolen, entered various states of consciousness, left my wits on Purple Mountain, met a toothless incomprehensible singer-songwriter and managed to share these experiences with two old friends from high school, a fellow Duke student, and two girls we met the week before we left.</p>
                <p>The road trip lasted from the 22nd to until the 16th of June for a total of 26 days. We stayed in a whole manner of places, from shitty hotels, to tents, the Las Vegas strip, and a Hooters Hotel. We started in New York City and drove through the night to Nashville, spending a few days there waiting for my friend from Duke to get out and meet us. From there we went from Memphis to New Orleans and then to Austin, where the party split up. My two friends from high school and I ventured on north into the wild of Yellowstone while my friend took our lady friends and went straight on to Los Angeles. The three of us who went to Yellowstone then spent a few days in looking at ourseleves in nature before moving on to the revelry of Las Vegas and finishing the trip with the rest of the cast in the Bay Area.</p>
