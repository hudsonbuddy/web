                <p>My parents keep telling me to do something, my friends keep telling me to find someone and I keep telling myself to stay somewhat grounded in reality. I spent the past year working for myself but at the same time working for nothing. I had some of the best times ever with some of my best friends ever, and certainly wouldn’t trade my past year for anything, but after a year out of college, my bank account is smaller than it was when I graduated. I don’t know what I want, certainly don’t know what I need, and haven’t gotten close to either so the Rolling Stones can go screw off.</p>
                <p>I needed to take a step back to figure it all out; take a breather and go back to the key of C. I decided to quit my first startup, sell off my piece of the company at the worst possible time for 10k cold cash. When people make a deal with the devil in the stories, they always think they can get out of it in time. That’s sort of what I figured I was doing.</p>
                <p>I had begun working on new project with some different people and we wanted to start in California. I have always been enchanted by the idea of a road trip across country and luckily, I had someone to brew with: my friend from high school, Nick Brennan. We grew up together swimming laps and both of us wanted to get out of Manhattan for a bit. He was working a bank teller job while writing and composing in his spare time, searching for what he truly loved as well. He loved the idea of the road trip. He was going to get fired from his job anyway, so why not? The plan was that we’d both drive across country together, I’d settle down in California, and he’d fly back. We started getting excited about all the cool stuff we could do and we got our friend Joo-Young to come along as well. Joo was another one of my friends from childhood.</p>

                <p>We had well-laid plans. We had the people. And we were all ready to go, now we just had to decide when to pull the trigger. I was living comfortably at home with the ‘rents and couldn’t find the impetus to get moving. Whether I left the next weekend or the one after didn’t really matter. In other words, it was very easy to procrastinate and very hard to build up that initial momentum to start moving. I needed to finish up some work in the city so I went with no plans of when to leave and that’s where the next and final three characters entered the picture.</p>
                <p>I was celebrating my friend’s birthday on his rooftop when lightning struck. All of us were singing “Call Me Maybe”. There were two girls by the side, sharing the roof and having a drink. Their names were Heather and Julia, best friends and roommates. We just both happened to be in the same place at exactly the right time and then also happened to be headed in the same direction at exactly the right time. People make connections for some unknown reasons and somehow, our lives decided to entwine for the next two weeks. A conversation that started that night at around 7PM between four strangers ended around midnight with an extra car in the trip. Nick, Joo and I together with Julia, Heather and David, my friend who I would be working with CA. It was happening and it was happening soon. I was going back that Sunday back upstate and we were leaving that Tuesday.</p>

                <p>They had to be in Austin by the 1st of June to make a flight and to get there on time and have fun on the way we had to leave ASAP. Nick and I would go with David, Julia and Heather until Austin, where we would then split off. David+Julia would stay south and go through Arizona, New Mexico to LA and Nick and I were going up North to meet with Joo in Yellowstone. And then, that Tuesday morning, the 22nd, Nick and I started for NYC with a full tank of gas, our fake names, Carlos Cruz and Darcy Bullets, trying to find whatever truth we could find in the world.</p>
