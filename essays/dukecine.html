                <p>[Our cinematography class met once a week, every week for my last semester of college. I had the pleasure of taking the class with some wonderful people, including the girl I ended up dating for a bit, Anna. We watched the following film together at her place one night, although I guess we both really didn’t want to watch it. Of all the assignments and movies we were supposed to watch, this was the only one I actually watched, enjoyed, and wrote originally about. The other assignments I just bull-shitted my way through. The pictures are not part of the assignment, but rather a different one where we were supposed to take pictures of interesting things around Duke Campus. I just put them in here to counteract wall of text.]</p>

                <p>This week I watched Fog Line, filmed by Larry Gottheim in 1970 with a Bolex Camera that we are using for our own assignments. The entire movie essentially takes place in the same location and takes place in real time, as in the time in the movie is exactly how much time passes in real life. It was shot in black and white and I did not notice sound, as the scene did not require it. The entire short takes place in about ten minutes and shows a field clearing of fog. However, as we will see, the movie is much more than what is on the surface.<br>
                <img src="/img/dukecine/scurve.jpg" class="mainimg"> 
                 <br><br>
                 The camera is placed on a hill and held still for the entire duration of the film, and since this is done with the Bolex, which only shoots in about thirty second takes, this requires a lot of planning. The entire film looks seamless and looks great although there must have been much cranking of the springs in the Bolex. The reason why this film succeeds is because there are no cuts and the entire film is just watching the fog. The film is long enough that the first time through it is almost impossible to watch through without losing attention, but short enough so that a viewer will want to watch again, to catch all the subtleties.<br>
                <img src="/img/dukecine/broken.jpg" class="mainimg">               
                  <br><br>
                  The film was shot in black and white, although by 1970 color was the medium of choice and main stream films had already all moved to color. The lack of color really strengthens the gradient of the fog as the film goes on, and allows the viewer to not be distracted by all the would be colors and focus on the changes in black and white, perhaps a small use of chiaroscuro.<br>
                <img src="/img/dukecine/bluejeans.jpg" class="mainimg">               
                   <br><br>
                   Also, the timing of the film is incredible, because over the course of the film, the fog clears slowly at a constant pace. If there had been a lull in the clearing of the fog, or maybe if the fog had cleared faster the same effect could not have been replicated. This film could have been shot exclusively at dawn or at the magic hour to achieve the lighting needed to make this work.<br>

                    <br><br>
                    As for composition, obviously we go to the title of the film, where we have already talked about the fog, but now onto the line. There are two lines at the top and bottom of the frame, following the rule of thirds and divide the frame up, and all the different trees are at different depths to give the viewer a nice gauge of depth in the frame as well as a good 2-dimensional grip as well. The composition is not obvious at first, as the only thing we see are the lines and the faint images of trees, but as the film comes into view, we see more and more of the masterful composition. The meadow has trees that are spaced out perfectly, that create balance and the sky has enough “head room” to make the framing well put together.<br>

                     Finally, this film mirrors the developing of a latent image of real film, as when one develops film, the image slowly comes into view, and as so does the movie itself. It is almost like the movie is a picture that the viewer is developing. Gottheim succeeded in making a film into a picture essentially, a very masterful piece. </p>
