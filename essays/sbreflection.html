                <p>I did not think I at first would be taking this House Course at the beginning of the year. My schedule had already been filled up to 5.75 credits as a senior and I did not want to add to my already stacked workload. However, as Cami was one of my best friends and I usually never miss out on a chance to make fun of her, I decided to take the class on whim as just a class that I audit and not take for credit. So far, my experiences in this class have aligned with many of my existing beliefs and have partly defined how I live the rest of senior year, and has been a great decision. <br>
                <br>
                I believe that education in its finest form is experiential. I have always thrived in environments where I could learn on the spot; I think that my greatest asset is my adaptability and ability to process new information. Because of this, this house course has brought me confirmation in this belief that experiential education actually does work and is important in our lives. From the beginning of time, human learning has always been a stimulus-response style of acquiring new knowledge and it is because we as a species can capitalize on this asset that we have found ourselves to be so successful. Sure, reading what other people have learned, their experiential education is important and there is no substitute for the real thing.<br><br>
                Thus, as I look back upon these past few weeks, I will try and relate my personal beliefs as much as possible, and also describe my thoughts as well as possible as opposed to simply relating and giving examples of what we have learned in the house course. I will try and use choice pictures as much as possible so that both one can see what I am describing, as well as lessen the length of this paper, as it is quite long, perhaps longer than my taste.<br>

                My spring break started with a road trip down to Miami with some of my best friends. However, a late addition to our road trip group defined our trip as being part of the five person team Awesome. Originally merely an acquaintance, my now good friend Sam joined our road trip last minute and became an integral part of our group dynamic, being the only girl among bros. <br>

                Being together in one space for an extended period of time will always bring people closer, and this time it was no different. Our conversations at the beginning of the road trip were usually of smaller things such as an exciting hour long game of fuck, kill and marry, very controversial indeed, and as familiarity with each other grew we talked about aspirations, beliefs and heavier things to the point of tears. Conclusion: Out of the billions of people in the world, there exists your friends, all you have to do is get the means to meet them; learn a new language, step out of comfort zones and actively try and meet new people, because all your friends are out there waiting for you. <br>
                <br>
                Spring break is one of the hallowed traditions of college; images of beaches, beer and drunken revelry immediately spring to mind when somebody says spring break.  This image is ingrained as spring break so much so that when people do other things on spring break, it is called “alternative spring break”. Being a senior, I have experienced my fair share on spring breaks so going into this one, I had already known what to expect, so I tried to clear my mind as much as possible and just take it all in as my last spring break. I have been busy from the start of the semester, so having a relaxing spring break is all I wanted. Below, we see pure relaxation and bliss, no awkwardness and just good sleep. <br>

                Conclusion: Vacation is a time when obligations are lost and thrown to the wind, and because of this, one's mindset and perceptions of fun are rapidly changed and in my opinion, easily fulfilled. Out of the four other people in my car, three of them found “cruise girlfriends” and “soulmates”. Although I am not saying there is no such thing as love at first sight, I think it may be a result of an environment; In other words, as we reflecting on our week, “It will always be easier to find an angel when you're in heaven”.<br>
                <br>
                As a senior, I am faced with the coming decision of what to do after graduation, a decision that could possibly define my adult years. First and foremost, when making this decision, I must find something that will make me happy. However, this is difficult if not impossible task, and therefore I have not defined the second aspect of making this decision. What can make Hudson Duan happy? If I were to ask myself, I would not know. Happiness might not be able to be described in a word, or even a sentence, but still, I do believe it is definable. <br>

                <br><br>
                Conclusion: I still have not figured out what happiness is, but I do believe it lies within our impulses. I think that a lot of the time, I am supressing my impulses, whether they be going to do something, or to talk to somebody, or saying something, because it would put me in an unfamilar and possibly unfortunate situation. However, I think that these situations must be faced and the more one can follow and lose oneself in exactly what they wish to do, i.e. Following impulses, the closer one can get to happiness.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, at the end of all this, although I am getting closer and closer to my friends and making lasting relationships, I feel the tug of something else, perhaps it could be said to be independence, but I feel like I am slowly moving away from people at the same time. I have found myself thinking much more by myself, and more and more satisfied with alone time. Perhaps it is a result of uncertainty, with my future and my ideas, and perhaps it is a result of maturity, but I do not know if it is a good thing or not. I love and savor my time with high octane things such as spring break and parties and all that, but somehow I always still find myself wandering in thought at what is happening. <br>
