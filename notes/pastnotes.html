                    people have energy loops and it takes activation energy to go to each loop and they get longer as you go up in consciouness, from dominant to transcendant, work is going from loop to loop, but wasted in not making it, the activation energy wasnt enough, for example talking to a hotel clerk in normal mode, and then trying to get them into a new situation/manager, which puts them in a higher level of work, which they may not want to do.<br>

                    camera's essentially are just a proxy for what you are looking at, more and more people are taking pictures of what they see, not just what theyve done, it can get more and more discrete, more pictures, more videos, able to piece together human life a little bit better, taking video is so casual now, it's just who you're looking at, blah blah, doesnt matter, that is why google glass video is so engaging and why we try and record what we see and expereince, and google glass does that exactly (the scene from her, remembering is first person video)<br>

                    gliding down the sand on a desert, after driving something over something construction and falling through and then looking behind and seeing that noone was there. i surfed down the sand, after coming back, and saw these men riding large elephants and two of their kids wanted to play with me and one of the elephants wanted me to ride him, they were like pigs with huge noses/trunks<br>

                    dream, i was on top of a waterfall, wading feet, black stuff in the water, a white family was saying are you the one to help kill this stuff, but you dont have the right shoes, i wnet down the waterfall, it feeds into the sheep, its in a valley, people live in the valley<br>

                    i saw an angel today...berkeley bowl, brown scarf, white, tan, blue eyes, abnormally tall, instantly thought of heaven, the desert, the oasis in the desert and the way she looked, tan tan almost a pure human, the alchemist reminded,  i literally had never seen anything like that before, my brain was completely puzzled, i was trying to see oh maybe shes a co-op or something and thats why shes buying so much food, but i think the truth is that she just shops once in a while and lives just like a normal normal human sapien...she also had pants that were cut off straight at the ass like the slut pants...a little bit of he hair was showing, on top of her head, she was blonde in the sun, tanned hair  almost fell off, had boxes full of food, kicked one of the boxes on the bottom, made eye contact twice, she smilied both times, i said oh my god, the cashier got pissed, right before this old azn couple bargined for like 5 mins about an avocado, she walked out, waited there, i tried to walk past her, got to my car, saw her again, and then i turned towards the sun and got back into my car...invitation to the dance. and then i was wearing the classic white v slut pants and the hair in the up and down style<br>
<br>
                    when somethign perfect like that does come along, i always turn around and run, i always turn around and run, i dont know what happened to me, i felt completely different, i couldnt look away i couldnt do anything i dont know what that was<br>

                     in order to "live in the future" and create somethign cool, you need to live in today, as in, stop thinking about plans, future trips, things looking forward too, like a movie, etc, all distractions from what is right in front of you, which all you need to do is stop thinking about distractions and other things<br>

                     lsd takes away the ability to use your preconceived notions, it allows you to de-condition yourself, it takes in true beauty of not assuming anything about the person, referring to inner beauty, to see true beauty is to learn so much about the person that your preconceived notions are completely blown out of the water. <br>

                         what makes us human is the ability to make mistakes. computers are perfect, they can calculate anything in the world, and they will never be wrong. this means, given infinity, it will never make a single mistake. however, there is no bad software, only bad hardware, where, there is a glitch and there will always be a glitch, and it is called human error. A human error is where, even though you can have everything go right, something, something magical could happen and it would not work. This error is something that will always be there and even though we are trying to eliminate this error, in automaticlly turning on lights, driving, power generation, the basic everything that we don't think about everyday, gas, electricity, something could go wrong, and this fear, this ultimate knowing, the one fact that everyone in the world knows one thing for sure, that you won't know what's coming next, keeps us all human, and this knowing, keeps us all going. why else do we have savings, and insurance and as many things as possible to eliminate this fear of not knowing whats coming and this intersection of how much we care about not knowing whats going to happen is how we  interact with people. there exists a meter, from 0-100 of how much you care abotu the future, in terms of plans, of no plans, of adventure of no adventure, how far are we willing to go to go outside of our way to see what we don't care about, like skydiving, many thigns could go wrong, but I dont care abou the future so lets go skydiving,  uptight people vs laidback vs not caring vs married, <br>

                         the opposite of life is time. the opposite of time is life. <br>
<br>
                         the meaning of life is the fight against entropy, it is the opposite of time, as time goes on, there is more and more entropy, as life goes on and on, it is the decrease of entropy. that is why we create computers, why we have insurance, why we drive safer cars, why we stick to routine, why we are attracted to certain people, because they contain traits that let life eliminate more entropy, why we value intelligence, less things go wrong for smart people, taller/stronger, less things go wrong, you can fix more things when tehy go wrong, you can reach for things that others cant, you are eliminating entropy, you have to keep fighting for life, that is why people who are in love are weak, because you are not living when you are in a relationship/married, you are flatlining, to live you must be actively decreasing your entropy, learning new things so you will be familiar with more things, just in case something goes wrong. <br>
<br>
                         people are interested only by people who are truly not into life, the decrease of entropy, to make your life easier, these people have transcended life, they have no longer any doubts of what will happen, and truly does not care, and that is why they die young...they truly do not care what happens the next day, and the reason why we, as life, find it interesting is because they have transcended life, they are gods, they do not care about what happens next. <br>

                         a prude is not someone who does not want to have sex, but rather someone who is intensely concerned about a society's approval and judgment such that they are concerned about all perceptions. very insecure and needs to be put out<br>
<br>
                         beauty is nothing, beauty inside counts for more, "your" beauty is the part of the preconcieneved notions like age college student age blonde short skinny that make me immeadiately have a version of you in my mind the second i noticed you...your real beauty is when you opened you mouth and started talking to me and now i learn who yo ureally are, the laughs the winks the frowns the tears the walk the way you look at and look to and look through people and the beauty of your love and family and favorite points in history and love and love of life and thats your beauty and thats your real beauty and why your beauty is nothing but a drop of nothing in a ocean of never was. <br>
<br>
                         beauty is like a nice car that you never drive, you are confined by your beauty, it holds you back from enjoying true beauty, the laughs and the  drives and the adventures...you don't want to crash the car and you are too conservative and you are judged by it. your beauty is singular and it's what defines you but you will lose it, you are passive with beauty, a beautiful person is passive because they dont need to do anything<br>
<br>
                         i can make anybody like anything, people just love things that are completely and utterly true, and every person has the capability to remove their insecurities and become 100% true, and then people will like it. music, products and living as long as it is more 100% true it is more successful...that is why campbells soup for andy warhol works, it's what he ate and thats why its true.<br>
<br>
                         driving down someone in a series of red lights at really late night, so all the sensors are off and everything...is like star wars episode 1...when qui gon is chasing darth maul down the hallway...its like the greens go on and then you chase a while, and then you get red...most times you dont gain a light, and the guy ahead of you knows to speed up when he sees you speed up...during the really long red lights, it's late night so tehy are super long, you are just sitting there, you and him, meditating and the radio is blaring the ba da ba da bum, no matter what station you were on, it starts playing that song and then when the chase ends because either you caught up or he turned, you both look at each other and know what happened.<br>
