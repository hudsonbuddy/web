                            <p>In college, I would randomly get ideas or things would pop in my head and these things disappear quickly so I started writing them down. I eventually started doing it in an email draft, and then in a google drive, but this was the start. These are the post-it notes that were taped to my wall in my dorm room.</p>

                            <p>I bought the Red Book the summer of 2009, right before I went to Australia, while I was working in Tarrytown for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. This was right after taking some cool film classes the past semester, courtesy of and together with Brendan Szulik. They inspired me to transition away from stuff like engineering and value truth.</p>
