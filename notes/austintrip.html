                <p>Hudson and Nick are sitting by a walkway along the Austin River, smack dab in the middle of Chaos in Tejas.<br>
                 <br>
                 H: Oh shit, check out that fucking snake dude! It stuck its head out of the water! It knew I was playing a song!<br>
                 N: You scared it away dumbass.<br>
                 H: Let me put some sunglasses on, hold on.<br>
                 N: It still doesn’t know what you are.<br>
                 H: You have whales on your shirt. You look like a fifth grade girl.<br>
                 N: Do you want to keep walking? Or are you going to remain in the fetal position?<br>
                 H: I’m kind of tripping, starting to get that insane feeling.<br>
                 N: Live like dragons…Are sure you don’t want to go further down the river?<br>
                 H: I am feeling really fucking good.<br>
                 N: Right, so let’s go see some more stuff.<br>
                 H: Give me that camera.<br>
                 N: Come and get it! Operate your body!<br>
                 H: Holy shit, what the fuck is going on with me right now? I’m tripping fucking hard right now.<br>
                 N: An overwhelming good right?<br>
                 H: Uhhhh…<br>
                 N: You know how you can keep cutting any distance in half and never get to where you started?<br>
                 H: You never really get there…<br>
                 N: Do you want to keep walking?<br>
                 H: I don’t know if I can function right now.<br>
                 N: You’re perfectly capable of functioning.<br>
                 H: Love is the one thing. Everyone wants love.<br>
                 N: I would play the blues right now if I could play them. What are you looking at?<br>
                 H: Life dude.<br>
                 N: It’s like watching grass grow.<br>
                 H: You miring, bro?<br>
                 N: Admiring? Yes, always.<br>
                 H: I need to jerk off. I haven’t had sex in so long.<br>
                 N: So go have sex.<br>
                 H: Yeah but I can’t enjoy it unless its with someone hot.<br>
                 N: Welcome to everyone’s problem, or at least the root of it.<br>
                 H: I want to fuck someone hot.<br>
                 N: Well no one’s going to fuck you collapsed in the fetal position like that. Or maybe C.W. would.<br>
                 H: I never believed in soul mates until one gay dude who happened to love lion taming met another gay dude who also happened to be into lion taming. What the flying fuck?<br>
                 N: Life is so bomb.<br>
                 H: I’m going to find my lion tamer and he’s going to be gay! Let me go!<br>
                 N: Get the fuck off your ass. Don’t take a shit.<br>
                 H: Dude, I’ve had so much awesome sex. I actually really like cameras a lot.<br>
                 N: Is that why you haven’t taken any pictures this whole trip?<br>
                 H: I’m going to take a picture of myself right now. What’s up gay?<br>
                 N: What do you think you look like?<br>
                 H: Let’s see if I look gay.<br>
                 N: You look like Dude Fest 2008.<br>
                 H: You never touch.<br>
                 N: You held your finger out.<br>
                 H: But that’s infinity when they don’t touch. You only try to get as close as possible.<br>
                 N: So I just broke infinity?<br>
                 H: Now you’re just a fucking fag.<br>
                 N: Fucking infinity? Get out of here.<br>
                 H: The fragments have to come all the way back.<br>
                 N: You’re about as straight as an asshole.<br>
                 H: You always want to take a shit at the worst possible time.<br>
                 N: Every time I’ve started my day walking in Austin I’ve always had to take a shit.<br>
                 H: You’re a fucking fag. Your butthole is so loose. Are you a girl?<br>
                 N: No. Are you?<br>
                 H: You’re a fucking fag.<br>
                 N: We are so high right now.<br>
                 H: We’re high as shit.<br>
                 N: Get as high as possible.<br>
                 H: Why am I always like this when I’m high?<br>
                 N: That’s the million dollar question.<br>
                 H: What is the question?<br>
                 N: What are you like, Hudson?<br>
                 H: I don’t know what I want out of life, do you?<br>
                 N: I want to be happy.<br>
                 H: Is it about a girl? How’s Michelle doing?<br>
                 N: Who knows.<br>
                 H: Call her.<br>
                 N: I don’t even know what I’m talking about right now. What could I tell her?<br>
                 H: Anything can be everything, everything can be anything.<br>
                 N: She never answers her phone.<br>
                 H: Everything can be anything, and anything can be everything. That’s what the symbol means. Everything is the same thing.<br>
                 N: What’s the symbol though?<br>
                 H: The two ever so perfectly parallel circles.<br>
                 N: The Slinkie you want to get tattooed to you?<br>
                 H: Right on my thigh, so the only the people who can see it are my wife, the mistress I’m cheating on my wife with, and the girl I’m cheating on my mistress with. But I would tell them all. Whenever I’m hooking up with someone and then hook up someone else I always tell them both.<br>
                 N: How does that work out?<br>
                 H: Terrible. For me, when it rains it pours. I have sex for like a fuck ton of time- a fuck ton of a short amount of time- and then go dry for like a million years.<br>
                 N: Have you ever heard of girlfriends?<br>
                 H: Yeah. I don’t like girlfriends. I could never really like a girlfriend. I’m not going to call someone my girlfriend because if I see another hot girl I’m going to fuck her and tell the other girl and then she’ll get pissed and never fuck me again, which happened with three of my past girls. None of them talk to me.<br>
                 N: I’m guessing that’s how you want it.<br>
                 H: Kind of, but that’s life dude.<br>
                 N: You take the good with the bad…<br>
                 H: Everything is one dude. It’s not good or bad.<br>
                 N: True that’s why you take the good with the bad- or with whatever they actually are- so then it doesn’t even matter what is what in the end.<br>
                 H: Fucking dumbass. Would you ever want to marry Michelle?<br>
                 N: I don’t know what marriage really entails, so right now no.<br>
                 H: I can’t believe Julia got married before me. I really, really respect that. I knew as soon as she said that she had been married that she was far out of my reach. Here is this girl who’s already been married before and I’m still just this complete fucking dumbass at the age of twenty-two. She’s two years older and knows what the fuck its all about.<br>
                 N: And now she’s trying to get back to where we are. She wants those two years back .<br>
                 H: True. I want to be her and she wants to be me. She has a weird fucking face though. I wish I had met up with Julia from Arkansas.<br>
                 N: What’s she doing?<br>
                 H: Life. And some collective bargaining on the side. She hates me probably. That’s the way that girls work man. Girls don’t mind work. As long as someone is giving them attractiveness points.<br>
                 N: They also just like to help out.<br>
                 H: That’s not what I’m trying to say at all. Girls don’t care about work. They care about working it. Their work is their attractiveness.<br>
                 N: That’s probably why they all sleep so much. Getting up is work.<br>
                 H: Yo they’re fighting! Look! Those two snakes are totally fighting! Live like dragons! I’m a fucking dragon! Motherfucker! I’m high!<br>
                 N: Chasing the dragon…<br>
                 H: Do you know why we have rules! Do you? Do you?!<br>
                  <br>
                  Nick starts making fun of Hudson’s incomprehensible imitation of the schoolmaster from ‘Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2’ that more closely resembles the teacher from ‘Peanuts.’<br>
                   <br>
                   N: You’re such a dumbass Hudson.<br>
                   H: You’re a dumbass. You’re the one who said that stupid shit.<br>
                   N: No. You’re the one who said it. Are you trying to say that I don’t know the words to Pink Floyd? That’s you. You’re the fucking dumbass. <br>
                   H: That was totally me.<br>
                   N: You didn’t even pretend to know the words. You just made all the song’s sounds a second behind the radio and hoped that no one would notice that you weren’t actually saying words.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sean enters the scene, walking down the stairs to the river walk.<br>
                     <br>
                     H: Live like dragons.<br>
                     N: He’s tripping on a lot of acid right now.<br>
                     S: Do you have anymore?<br>
                     N: I wish.<br>
                     S: Do you want a beer?<br>
                     N: Hell yeah! We have some more beers in the car too, but…we can’t remember which way our car is.<br>
                     S: It’s cool. Three dollar six pack from Walgreen’s.<br>
                     H: So what do you do man? You chilling?<br>
                     S: Thinking of heading to Trailer Space.<br>
                     H: Oh shit, that’s where we’re going!<br>
                     N: We’re from New York. Where are you from?<br>
                     S: Portland, Oregon.<br>
                     H: West Coast. I’m moving to the Bay.<br>
                     S: Nice, there’s some cool skate spots around there.<br>
                     H: I don’t skate much but I could totally pick it up if there are some cool spots around.<br>
                     N: When was the last time you skated Hudson?<br>
                     H: Like when I was ten. But it can’t be that difficult.<br>
                     N: What’s your name dude?<br>
                     S: Sean.<br>
                     N: What’s up dude, I’m Nick.<br>
                     H: Hudson.<br>
                     N: Yeah we’re just passing through for a few days, but we haven’t moved for about an hour because we’ve been tripping so hard. Oh shit, you got a program! Chaos in Tejas has those?<br>
                     S: I have an extra one if you want.<br>
                     N: That would be seriously sweet.<br>
                     H: Motherfucker came prepared dude.<br>
                     N: It’s the backpack. Gotta have the backpack.<br>
                     S: This is the first time I’ve had it in a while. Now that I think of it I’m probably just going to head to Beer Land pretty soon instead.<br>
                     N: I’ve literally never heard of any of these bands.<br>
                     S: Do you listen to a lot of punk?<br>
                     N: It’s hard for me to say anymore. All of our music just got stolen the other day, so we’ve been listening to comedy radio since and have kind of forgotten all about music and what we listened to.<br>
                     H: I had both of my guitars stolen too.<br>
                     S: What from your car?<br>
                     N: I mean I like punk music, I just don’t really know what’s going on with it.<br>
                     H: We went to the Beauty Ballroom show last night. That was good.<br>
                     N: You wanted to leave before it was over. Do you know if Art vs. Science is any good? That’s the band we missed.<br>
                     S: I don’t know. I missed that too. That show was all the way on the other side of town.<br>
                     N: It was convenient for us though because our campground was right across the street.<br>
                     S: I slept in this creek last year all four days. There’s going to be a breakfast show tomorrow that should be pretty good too. No Static is playing. They’re one of my favorites.<br>
                     N: Sounds like you’ll be starting your tomorrow off right.<br>
                     S: So you live in New York?<br>
                     N: The Bronx.<br>
                     S: Is that as crazy as it sounds?<br>
                     N: No, its mad boring. I haven’t even seen my room yet though. I just gave my friends my shit and told them I would probably be back. I like how close all these shows are though. They’re all just right across the street from one another.<br>
                     S: Word dude.<br>
                     N: Sweet.<br>
                      <br>
                      Sean picks up the ukulele and shows us a wild double-picking technique, which says he picked up while his friend had one.<br>
                       <br>
                       H: Is this good man? I haven’t even had a taste of it.<br>
                       N: You just don’t know anything that’s going on right now Hudson. Should we get going dude?<br>
                       H: Wait, what’s going on right now man?<br>
                        <br>
                        Birds chirp like typewriters in the background.<br>
                         <br>
                         N: Have you been to Austin before?<br>
                         S: Yeah, I came for Chaos two years ago. But I couldn’t drink then because I was twenty.<br>
                         H: We’re the exact same age man. That’s fucking cool. We went to the Beauty Ballroom last night. It started out really well. Sphynx killed it. But after that we started to pass out. Cheap Girls fucking sucked. And they were the second largest font. They deserved to be the fourth. Maybe. You couldn’t even see Sphynx on the sign!<br>
                         N: They were exactly what there name was.<br>
                         H: Yo give me that fucking uke yo.<br>
                         N: You’re wearing all my clothes right now. You have nothing.<br>
                         H: That’s so true. They took our bowl too.<br>
                         N: But they left the weed.<br>
                          <br>
                          G warns about drinking beer in the park, asks us for a smoke.<br>
                           <br>
                           H: That’s not the goal for the majority of my nights (referring to fucking a girl)<br>
                           N: I’m aware.<br>
                           H: The goal for the majority of my nights is to chill fucking hardcore and figure out what I want out of life.<br>
                           N: A fucking hot girl.<br>
                           H: Well, yeah, but…just having a hot body doesn’t mean she’s hot. She has to be attractive.<br>
                           N: Yeah, I see what you’re talking about.<br>
                            <br>
                            Sean talks about water park run by a river about an hour north of Austin.<br>
                             <br>
                             H: We should go somewhere really fucking close.  This sounds really far away right now…Oh man, stood up. That was a big step.<br>
                             N: I took four hits, so like…<br>
                             H: Ha, ha, ha!<br>
                             N: Everything is moving right now…<br>
                             H: I know man.<br>
                             N: Are you good at rolling joints?<br>
                             S: Do you want a filter?<br>
                             N: Hell yeah!<br>
                             S: I got some tobacco for a spliff too.<br>
                             N: Oh you have a real filter. I thought you were just going to tear one off. What kind of tobacco is that?<br>
                             S: American spirit.<br>
                             N: That’s American spirit? That’s purple…<br>
                             H: Yo we need a grinder. This is so annoying to break up.<br>
                             N: We should have realized this like four years ago.<br>
                             H: I can’t do this right now. I’m like kind of constipated. This is so hard. This is definitely not a good idea right now.<br>
                             S: I can do it.<br>
                             H: You do it. You do it. I’m like, oh my god…I used to be able to jump real fucking high, but my left knee is like…Life is all about you, and possibilities…<br>
                             N: The impossible dream…<br>
                             H: It’s all about possibilities…There’s no possibility of me playing in the NBA anymore. It’s all about youth. You just want to be younger again…<br>
                             N: Or to be a better basketball player…<br>
                             H: So what do you do man?<br>
                             S: For work?<br>
                             H: I don’t know. What do you do?<br>
                             S: Well, I work in a group home with people with disabilities.<br>
                             N: You should probably spliff that.<br>
                             S: I’m trying to get a bike through a friend of friend while I’m here, but it still hasn’t happened. Damn, I’m really shaky right now.<br>
                             H: Yeah dude, we’re on so many drugs right now, so it’s all good, whatever. I think we smoked already too.<br>
                             N: You had one hit.<br>
                             H: But that’s usually enough for me.<br>
                             S: Is that an Asian thing? Like one hit and I’m high as shit.<br>
                             H: I usually never smoke so I don’t really have a tolerance.<br>
                             N: You smoke all day.<br>
                             H: Recently, yes, but my experiences with you are very limited and usually involve smoking weed. I don’t smoke all day. I just smoke with you. I love smoking weed though. It is quite possibly an Asian thing. Asians just go on drugs and go on drugs. Are you Chinese dude?<br>
                             S: Half Chinese.<br>
                             H: Nice dude. Is your dad Chinese?<br>
                             S: No my mom is. Doesn’t it usually work out like that?<br>
                             N: You just remind us of our friend who is also half Chinese but on his dad’s side.<br>
                             H: Being Chinese is pretty sweet.<br>
                             S: Good food.<br>
                             H: Life, bro, life. What does it mean?<br>
                             S: Yeah. Are you driving back to New York?<br>
                             N: Flying.<br>
                             H: You got these massive thighs dude.<br>
                             S: It sucks. Finding pants that you won’t put holes in is a challenge.<br>
                             H: But don’t you skateboard a bunch?<br>
                             S: Yeah I guess that could be it too.<br>
                             N: You’re the man for rolling us this joint by the way.<br>
                             S: Yeah, I know doing anything on acid sucks. The first time I tripped, well, my aunt’s a cop right? And I show up at her house for a barbeque with a couple of friends from San Francisco after a really great day at the beach and all these cops are coming in, it was so weird. I was playing with the kids and being all weird.<br>
                             N: That’s like out of a movie dude. You’re tripping going to where all the cops are, at your house.<br>
                             H: Fucking life dude. Fucking life. Story time dude. Let’s have story time. What’s your story man?<br>
                             S: Last time I was in Austin, I was sleeping in this creek<br>
                             N: Here?<br>
                             H: Yeah, we went over this. You’re a dumbass.<br>
                             S: Yeah, for about two nights, it was farther down that way I think, and I was in this alley by the creek that leads to Beer Land, people were stepping all over me and shit, it was like eight in the morning, and this dude walks up, he was in his like thirties and he’s with this young twenty-something Indian kid and he was like, ‘Alright, let’s smoke this crack,’ takes a hit and screams at the top of his lungs, and the Indian kid takes a hit, looks at me like what the fuck am I doing, and then starts running down the creek. Then he offers me some and I just got up and left.<br>
                             N: He bolts right after. Exactly the reaction you would want for the moment.<br>
                             H: It’s a perfect, ‘What the fuck?’ Your life is kind of like a movie, I think. I’m fucking stoned.<br>
                             N: Of course it is. Did you get your sandals stolen too? I’ve never seen you wear those shoes.<br>
                             H: I’m just always on vacation.<br>
                             N: Adaptation.<br>
                             H: All my clothes are yours right now.<br>
                             S: There’s a Salvation Army around here.<br>
                             H: I’m literally not too worried about it.<br>
                             N: It’s fucking hilarious.<br>
                             S: What’s Dude Fest?<br>
                              <br>
                              Hudson and I erupt into laughter, at his obliviousness to his ridiculous appearance, as if all clothes were made equal.<br>
                               <br>
                               N: It’s like, ‘How could you not ask?’ But it’s the camp I worked at, and all the dude counselors decided to be assholes, make obnoxious shirts, and form an army on no premise, more or less to just be assholes, officially.<br>
                               S: Is there a reason that it says 2008 on it?<br>
                               N: That’s just pop culture right there.<br>
                               H: We look like fucking degenerates right now.<br>
                               N: We are, Hudson.<br>
                               H: You’re so fucking gay.<br>
                                <br>
                                I run off to take a piss in the bushes off the path.<br>
                                 <br>
                                 H: We’re all bros here, we’re all bros. Not guidos. See, guidos think we’re weird, that bros are weird. Like guidos would never smoke weed.  They’re all about getting drunk, doing MDMA, and going to clubs and shit. Bros are better.<br>
                                 N: We’re dudes.<br>
                                 H: We’re dudes. We’re all dudes. We’re all bros. Can I buy this shit off of you?<br>
                                 N: Never. Unless I can’t wear it again.<br>
                                  <br>

That’s part of it. But when you’re on drugs, you don’t think about survival. That’s why you learn everything the day you die. Because you’re not thinking about survival, like when you’re on drugs.<br>

But I guess that’s still why everything can be said to work out. You can’t ask someone who’s dead what happened, no?<br>

Because you’re you if you’re trying to figure that out. Just the thought that something exists takes you away from where you are.<br>

She was my TA, kind of. I would skip every class. She didn’t know who I was. I turned in one assignment and did pretty good. The first time I actually spent time with her was when she was filming this movie and I was on set helping her move shit from seven at night until one in the morning. It was ridiculous. Then after that, we went to a cast party, smoked a ton of weed, did a ton of drugs, and got on level. But then she got really sick and almost died. The girl that I was totally in love with was about to die before my eyes. And I hadn’t even known her for twenty-four hours. She was on so many drugs. We finally got her to the ER and got her back though. I didn’t talk to her though, not until about February. Then, she came up to New York to do a random shoot, we got a hotel room, fucked all night, and then she left. She knew me better than I knew myself. I hadn’t even known her for a whole day.<br>

                                                                                                                                            N: She would have followed me to the end of the earth if I knew where the fuck that was. I didn’t have my shit together.<br>
                                                                                                                                            H: Is that why she ended it?<br>

That’s why I’m on this road trip. Because I don’t know myself. And I want to figure that out. I just know I want to do something with my life. But tell me about Michelle.<br>
                                                                                                                                            N: Why? We’re not even together anymore.<br>

I just want to see how you remember it. I’ve burned every bridge I’ve ever crossed by the way. I fall for women so easily…Everyone’s going to die, but what binds you to life is other people.<br>
                                                                                                                                            N: Looking for the right words…That’s when I fell in love with Michelle. We were playing this game she learned from writing camp where you had to define yourself using only five words, one for each finger of a hand. And she was: Looking for the right words. Then I just knew.<br>
                                                                                                                                            H: Mel and I were in this car, high as fucking possible, holding hands, and it was right before she got sick. She started clenching my hand, but in infinitely small steps. You could have barely seen her hand moving, but it was. She did this for about half an hour until I was literally squeezing her hand. Then she started to scream in pain. But there was that moment where it was so good, and I’ve never had that with anybody else. It changed my life. I was like there. It felt so fucking good. She was screaming like a whale. Her whole body started twitching except the one hand I was holding. She was too crazy for me man.<br>
                                                                                                                                            N: The first time that Michelle told me that she loved me, I was hanging out with my friend Mel. I was taking Mel back up to my apartment to crash and Michelle was getting off the train to go back to her place, and then she said it. It’s funny that there is a Mel character that’s common to both stories of the loves our lives.<br>
                                                                                                                                            H: The reason I think I’ve hurt so many girls is that I don’t know myself.<br>
                                                                                                                                            N: Yeah, but how do you find yourself?<br>
                                                                                                                                            H: I know it’s my fault.<br>

                                                                                                                                            N: Just gotta keep slowly collecting things and bringing them under my breath. Then, they’re gonna pop out without my control, all these things that I gather, once I get enough of them, and I won’t be able to know how anything I pass will set me off, much less what I will pass.<br>

And then scientists measure their brainwaves when they describe something like that, and see that the brain is taking a path to a memory that isn’t there.<br>
                                                                                                                                            N: So déjà vu is the activation of memory somewhere where memory should not be activated?<br>
                                                                                                                                            H: But as soon as you realize déjà vu, its over.<br>

Drugs is like cleaning the windows. It doesn’t open them to let you out…Look at that group of girls. It’s like, Fuck. Hot. Hot. Hot.<br>
                                                                                                                                            N: Dancing in a parking lot. I wish I could just show everyone that there’s no meaning.<br>

                                                                                                                                            N: But that’s why there can’t be meaning. Because everyone has their own view of the trees. But how do you convince someone of what you think when the ground you’re standing on is crumbling beneath you?<br>
                                                                                                                                            H: That’s very high. That’s a very high thing to say. That’s a very retarded-ass-ass comment.<br>
                                                                                                                                            N: How is that retarded?<br>
