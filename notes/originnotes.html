ni skeptical of ne, same with si and se, se messes up si, same as with ne messing up ni, ni cant predict ne, and si cant plan for se<br>

the concept of 5 only comes into being with two celetial bodes, lagrange points<br>
<br>
we have always looked to the stars for answers, for navigation, for talking about the same ideas<br>
<br>
ni wants to figure it out, si has done it before so it must be doable, ni needs to figure it out, and then doable, but things can change so it may not be si-able, and the future is unknown so it may not be ni-able<br>

for every action there is an equal and opposite suppression<br>

    it is possible to achieve parity in your functions, but such a person would not be a human, they woiuld not be easy to be friends with, they have no weaknesses, they are a robot, they cannot bond easily with others, they are the noble gases <br>

    time is dialating because of us, 1 sec now means 5 minutes, 5 minutes now means like 15,<br>

    i wronged somehow, went by myself and proved that time was dilating with the time=location argument against someone, i saw kcorn, somehow apologized, felt up her tits<br>

    dreamed that teeth were falling out, crossfit, the retainers let me play with the teeth like as a kid, rolling them around and stuff, i tried to hide it<br>

    the function that we parent with, if input, then that becomes your kids dominant function because it will be what they become used to doing<br>
    <br>
    people with input dom want to be somebody, but people with output dom want to do something, this comes from the parenting of the other function. people with input dom wait their kids to be somebody, they “dont want to be somebody theyre not” and what to do something. people with output dom want their kids to do something, and their kids dont want to do just a goal, they want to be somebody unique and their own person, not their parents, who just do things<br>
    <br>
    i was in a mansion, revolution, shoot for the weapon not the cross, the weapon was shot at, i was hiding and then i ran out the window and thought about who i could go back to, all the way home, the person who shot at it was andy i think, also i saw cami who warned me not to be so nonchalant with what i say, i also showed my left hand to someone through a door and was rejected and shooed away after just being in side<br>

        mbti parenting -> 2nd function to children -> different dominant functions for a generation -> strauss howe generational theory -> each generation has its own dom, we are in the time of the inuitives, about to be a land of feelings...input function to output function, “your generation isn’t like the generation that shaped you, but it has much in common with the generation that shaped the generation that shaped you.” each part of life is dealing with a certain period of your 4 functions<br>
