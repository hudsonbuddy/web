                <p>N is Nick, the guide who recorded this all. H is me.

                <p>N: The ways these trees are parted reminds me of this one spot in (what’s the name of the park?) Tompkins Square Park!- where the trees are arranged in such a circle around you that their branches touch to form a perfect triangle window to the sky over your head.<br>
                H: These trees are the perfect metaphor for life. The only way for you to know these trees in front of me is for you to put your face exactly where mine is and look. I can’t tell you.<br>
                N: The triangle wouldn’t have existed in the trees had I moved. That’s why I couldn’t move the whole day.<br>
                H: And also why if someone else came here they wouldn’t be able to see it.<br>
                N: They wouldn’t get it. Yeah…They’d be in a whole other movement.<br>
                H: I’ve thought about that a few times. Like I was looking at some rocks once and realized both how cool they were and that if I told anyone about why they were cool they would’ve never fucking understood. They would’ve been like, ‘Wait, what are you talking about?’…That’s what makes art art. The shit you can’t say.<br>
                N: That’s how they figure out shit to draw.<br>
                H: They got their own window. That’s the reason I want to make art.<br>
                N: You can’t be wrong.<br>
                H: That’s also why I don’t know what I’m trying to do.<br>
                N: I know what I want to do, but it’s just what many people don’t have success in.<br>
                H: I know what I want to do, this just isn’t the venue for it. I want to live in a place where I don’t have to survive my genes. Not the human world I guess.<br>
                N: Like a dojo?<br>
                H: What?<br>
                N: A Monastery?<br>
                H: Kind of, but it’s still like human life…What the flying fuck are we doing in Memphis, Tennessee?<br>
                N: To see a concert, you idiot!<br>
                H: Our lives are so fucking stupid!<br>
                N: What do you mean? Why don’t you just enjoy being here? What would you rather be doing?<br>
                H: (indiscernible moaning noise)…I don’t know…I have no idea…<br>
                N: Exactly. That’s your problem. My problem.<br>
                H: I have no idea what’s going on…That’s like the central thesis of everything…What I’m trying to say is I have no idea what the fuck is going on!<br>
                N: Yeah, you said that.<br>
                H: That’s what Heather was trying to tell me last night. I was trying to describe how I feel to her, or what I thought of her, and I just couldn’t…Being sober is such a different life. Everything is about this one idea. It’s about a girl.<br>
                N: It doesn’t have to be.<br>
                H: That’s how I know to do things. This idea is instinct. You were born trying to have this one idea.<br>
                N: You don’t even know the idea you’re trying to have. You’re just trying to have it.<br>
                H: This is the reason I fear drugs, because I fear I’d kill myself on them.<br>
                N: Why would you fear that?<br>
                H: Because when I’m on drugs I realize that there is no real separation between life and death.<br>
                N: No, there totally is.<br>
                H: Not really.<br>
                N: If there is no separation, then why would you kill yourself?<br>
                H: I haven’t seen death.<br>
                N: You want to go to a place where there is no fear, is that what you’re trying to say?<br>
                H: I don’t want to, but I fear that I would, while I’m on drugs.<br>
                N: Well, we’re living the dream, now.<br>
                H: This is actually insane.<br>
                N: I know. When I gave my boss a week’s notice to leave for this trip, he told me that I was actually the craziest person that worked at the branch…How can you ever think you know anything about life and death? Literally, no one knows. Who comes back from the dead? It’s a place of eternal non-knowing.<br>
                H: I want to read. I want to do something. I want to be cool…<br>
                N: What do you want to do?<br>
                H: I finally get what all these fucking people are saying.<br>
                N: Who?<br>
                H: All the people that I’ve been blocking out from the world. They’re rushing past me now…People have been telling me things my entire life. I just don’t do them. Yin Yang? I finally understand that shit, dude. The entire time they’ve just been trying to explain that shit.<br>
                N: Maybe you could explain it to me.<br>
                H: It’s just about how everything is one dude.<br>
                N: How is it one dude?<br>
                H: There are always different sides…There is you, yourself, a vessel, which is you. You are one side and the other is what you are perceiving as. But no matter what, it’s like that Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. My entire life is actually built upon this. You cannot observe something perfectly.<br>
                N: Yang is just everything outside of yourself?<br>
                H: Yeah but the thing is that everything outside of you is like that not inside you, like that blackness inside you, and you’re still creeping into that other part.<br>
                N: Where are you? Are you just between Yin and Yang?<br>
                H: You are one of them. You are something in between. As you move from one to the other you don’t know what you are…Yo my entire life has just been cosmos and shit, this is crazy, and it wasn’t really hitting me, but know it’s hitting me. It’s like holy shit dick.<br>
                N: Now you’re stoned.<br>
                H: It’s fucking happening, dude! The whole point of Yin and Yang is that there’s no such thing as yourself without the outside world. You cannot live without that one rule…I am fucking awesome right now!<br>
                N: Yeah, you are.<br>
                H: I am perfectly clear in my head right now. I am perfectly fucking clear in my head right now dude. I know exactly what I’m going to do!<br>
                N: What’s that?<br>
                H: I’m just going to live my life.<br>
                N: Exactly.<br>
                H: People have been trying to tell me that my entire life, too.<br>
                N: Because there is nothing else to be done.<br>
                H: There is nothing else to be done.<br>
                N: What am I going to tell you? It’s your life. Go live it.<br>
                H: I know…Holy shit…Yeah…<br>
                N: It’s about art dude, there’s no right or wrong.<br>
                H: It’s just your life. That’s it. That’s what Yin and Yang is. That’s life. Everything is life.<br>
                N: But where did it come from?<br>
                H: It didn’t come from anything. It’s just there. Everything is just there. There is no such thing as things.<br>
                N: So what are we doing right now?<br>
                H: We’re just existing.<br>
                N: With things.<br>
                H: Yeah.<br>
                N: But there are no things.<br>
                H: There’s no definition of it.<br>
                N: Once you see everything through a broader spectrum…<br>
                H: Human are trying to create chaos, essentially. Every word in the dictionary is just chaos. Everything is really just life.<br>
                N: You can’t put a definition on it. It’s like putting a film over what’s occurring.<br>
                H: It’s still going to be life. At the very end of it, it’s just life.<br>
                N: I think that the words are chaos but I don’t think people try to escape that chaos through words. It gives them something to communicate absolute nothingness out of. What would you say about everything that’s going on?<br>
                H: You couldn’t communicate if there wasn’t any chaos. If there was no chaos, then there would be no humans. Life is about chaos…Holy shit! I am so clear in my head right now!<br>
                N: That’s life. What could be clearer?<br>
                H: It’s so beautiful. It’s such a fucking beautiful thing…Everything has there own life, even you and I. Like why am I trying to talk to you? You have your own life, bro. But we depend on each other for life. I am going to roll over and grab this bottle of water because it is part of my life. If I don’t have water, then I don’t have life, so I’m going to drink your fucking water. I’m going to drink the shit out of it. Shit, I can’t even drink this!<br>
                N: We’ve been tripping for a long ass time. What time is it? I don’t even know where I was. Does it matter?<br>
                H: Life has always been happening, whether we see it or not. That’s the whole fucking point of fucking Yin Yang. To achieve something without having to perceive it. Like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I want to be a fucking scientist. In order to see something, it’s not beautiful anymore. That’s the whole fucking point. I am so fucked up right now. I am fucking gone.<br>
                N: Becoming one with everything!<br>
                H: This is like bringing me closer and closer to death.<br>
                N: What is?<br>
                H: I fear if I listen to music I’ll kill myself.<br>
                N: That’s kind of what happened to me when I got the highest I ever got at Colin’s house. Remember when I ate that whole plate of brownies? That’s the thing! I thought I was going to die! The great spirit came to me in a kaleidoscope of a million tiny pixels, basically took away the world’s vision, and asked me to go with the river. I was like, ‘This sounds awesome but I’m definitely going to die if I do and I totally forgot to do something back home. So I was like I need to eat these brownies to reassert my physical self and stay in this world.’<br>
                H: You’re never going to know. That’s the whole thing about knowing. The whole fucking point of life is that no one knows what the hell is going on.<br>
                N: You know what’s going on. You’re going crazy right now. But that is the point. I’m glad someone is screaming it. No one does. But that’s the whole point of life. Everyone knows no one knows, but they pretend they do and find something else to do.<br>
                H: Life is about being chaos. The point is to realize chaos, that there is.<br>
                N: So many possibilities.<br>
                H: Our job is to make sure…we don’t have a job…<br>
                N: What is our job Hudson?<br>
                H: Our job is to live our life.<br>
                N: That’s a good bumper sticker. You could make a lot of money. I feel like a lot of people would buy into that.<br>
                H: Life has always been just life. That’s the thing. There’s no reason to figure out what anyone’s doing. What is this? It’s just life. And the absence of shit is also life.<br>
                N: That’s true. It’s the chaos, what you can’t define.<br>
                H: And you’ll never be able to figure it out unless you’re on drugs…That’s what I want to fucking do!<br>
                N: That is…<br>
                H: I want to be an artist.<br>
                N: Why?<br>
                H: Artistry is being able to become someone else, being able to see what another person sees through their eyes, saying a word and being able to transplant yourself and this other person from and into that word and what you’re saying. It’s life. Other humans, the human condition, is life…<br>
                N: So then you can do all that without being an artist. Empathy? You can do that everyday. Or is everyone an artist?<br>
                H: I don’t know. I just don’t know what the fuck is going on. At the end of the day…<br>
                N: Yeah, living is always like, ‘Flowers are blossoming, wind is blowing in the air…’ But we’re in such an age dude. We’re right on the cusp…<br>
                H: There is nothing that separates anything. It’s all just life…<br>
                N: This grass is like an ocean…I’m fitting in very nicely…<br>
                H: It’s like, ‘Why are we here?’ Because we don’t have jobs! What do you think would happen if we just went over to that whole party taking wedding photos and tried to explain what we were doing? They would never understand us. Because it’s all just life.<br>
                N: What would you want them to do? Look at us! How could they? What if we walked over and crashed their wedding in just these tang tops? We scream that we’re on drugs! What could you say? Oh I just wanted to have sex with the bride! Seriously Hudson? The most apparent girl to have sex with is the one getting married.<br>
                …<br>
                N: This is what we get for planning. The one thing we planned didn’t work out. That’s why it’s great! Because life is great!<br>
                H: I finally figured out why people are always talking about balance. Balance is just life. Balance is just like…Why do you balance? To figure out how to adjust to life and its conditions…Life is order. Life is other people’s order that you have to fit in with.<br>
                N: That’s why you need to figure out where life came from. You can’t remove the way it is but you can change it.<br>
                H: People have done drugs before us people will keep doing drugs.<br>
                N: If you want to do it, do it. Time’s a waiting.<br>
                H: I am getting dumb right now!<br>
                N: I feel like I’m on another planet.<br>
                H: I feel like I’m dying…Life and death are actually the same thing. The day you were born is the day you start dying.<br>
                N: Life goes on. Whether you have your things around you or not. Furniture? Who cares?<br>
                H: It can affect your life.<br>
                N: It can affect your life. That’s the whole point. But I want to make a world for someone else to come into.<br>
                H: We’re still trying to communicate with humans that haven’t even been born yet obviously…<br>
                N: I think the pyramid is talking to you right now…<br>
                H: Exactly.<br>
                N: If only we could drive there.<br>
                H: I am totally not walking anywhere. I am tripping fucking nuts right now. Everything is just life.<br>
                 <br>
                 The two start walking. Still no one has a clue about the sunset symphony, much less how to get there.<br>
                  <br>
                  N: Oh, that’s why we didn’t go anywhere before. We don’t know where we’re going.<br>
                  H: Where the fuck are we going?<br>
                  N: Let’s check out this park.<br>
                  H: Look at that fucking life! Why did I do that? That was just fucking life.<br>
                  N: You can’t even drink your water. C’mon, dawg.<br>
                  H: Why did I do that? That’s instinct. That’s life.<br>
                  N: Everyone just left with their shit today. They’re gone.<br>
                  H: What the fuck? Am I lifing right now?<br>
                  N: Yeah I think we…Stop trying to describe it. I know it’s awesome.<br>
                  H: That’s life though.<br>
                  N: You’re a long way from home man…<br>
                  H: Can you swim in that water?<br>
                  Two passer byes in unison: No!<br>
                  N: Is this the Mississippi?<br>
                  Woman 1: Yes. Yes it is.<br>
                  H: Is there anywhere we can swim? Is the day you stop worrying about it the day you die? What happens when you die?<br>
                  N: Look at all these pebbles on the ground.<br>
                  H: But that’s life. I can’t even appreciate that, all the little things you’re trying to see. But the things we like to do, other people like to do. It’s about finding people to do those things with. I just have to train myself to be high all the time. Like Super Seon.<br>
                  That’s what you should be saying to everyone you meet in life: ‘You’re a fucking dumbass.’<br>
                  N: What are you talking about. You’re a fucking dumbass.<br>
                  H: But see that says more than me saying that I’m going to write down shit. As long as you’re lifing, then it doesn’t matter what the vessel is. That’s why I love life. Life is just life.<br>
                   <br>
                   The dude who Nick lied to about not having cigarette on the way down to the river comes galloping down to the shore to meet them.<br>
                    <br>
                    C: Are you older? Older people rock! Are you old enough? What are y’all?<br>
                    H: Let’s fucking life.<br>
                    C: I love life. At least you’re old enough. Now don’t be asking me no questions about fucking life because I don’t want to hear it! Y’all don’t pick on me.<br>
                     <br>
                     (Red flag that he is taking us down the wrong way or steering us away from an impossible path in the manner of a savior)<br>
                      <br>
                      N: We’re trying to figure out how to get to the Sunset Symphony.<br>
                      C: I’m trying to figure out how I have a cigarette but don’t have a cigarette.<br>
                      N: Do you know if it’s cool to smoke a joint around here?<br>
                      C: I’m not from here either. I’m a singer/songwriter on my way to Nashville.<br>
                      H: This is fucking life.<br>
                      C: You probably think I’m bullshitting. But now that I came to a momentary destination, who’s smoking the weed, man? Because I don’t fucking care. I’ll roll that shit. I’ll be responsible. I was sipping on all these beers and I was like, ‘What the fuck, man?’ But really, do you want to take me up on my music vocabulary?<br>
                      N: Why do you think we’re here?<br>
                      C: Funny? Serious? What do you want to hear?<br>
                      N: Funny.<br>
                      C: Funny? Funny?<br>
                      H: However you’re feeling with life right now.<br>
                      N: Whatever floats your boat.<br>
                      C: Alright this song is about robbing banks. Have you ever heard of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner?<br>
                      N: I know the cartoon.<br>
                      C: Y’all don’t know who the fuck they were? Huh?<br>
                       <br>
                       The song begins.<br>
                        <br>
                        Y’all want Road Runner like the law men want me<br>
                        Five law banks and twenty two states and never been caught you see<br>
                        Never hurt no one and I really hate guns but I’m quick on my feet<br>
                        And every time I leave a crime you can hear me go meep meep meep<br>
                        Catch me if you can, you see me now you don’t<br>
                        H: That’s fucking life.<br>
                        C: I ain’t be bullshitting you.<br>
                        H: Dude, what the fuck. That was so fucking good.<br>
                        C: You can’t even handle no weed, huh? Y’all heard of Sir-Mix-a-Lot<br>
                         <br>
                         C.W. jumps into river.<br>
                          <br>
                          C: I’m not supposed to be in here. I don’t want to be all muddy either.<br>
                          H: That’s fucking life.<br>
                          N: The weed’s in our car. I found my cigarettes though.<br>
                          C: I’ve never been in the Tennessee before!<br>
                          H: The Mississippi.<br>
                          N: It’s all water!<br>
                          H: There’s no definition: It’s just life.<br>
                          C: I slipped in the mud. I had no choice but to jump in. I’m sorry if I embarrassed you guys right now.<br>
                          H: Hell no. Life is what happened right now. Like why are we even doing anything but lifing?<br>
                          C: It makes it harder when you’re fucking wet. It does. I feel embarrassed.<br>
                          N: Why do you feel embarrassed? It’s mad hot outside.<br>
                          C: Because I tripped.<br>
                          N: I didn’t even see that dude. You just went into the water.<br>
                          H: Embarrassment is life. If you like it, then it’s not embarrassing.<br>
                          N: I can’t even remember what I did.<br>
                          H: He’s my R.A.<br>
                          N: It’s kind of like a god of the sun.<br>
                          C: Your mind is like a fucking parachute homes. That thing only works when its open.<br>
                          H: Everything is life.<br>
                          C: What are y’all doing down here anyway?<br>
                          H: Life, man, life.<br>
                          C: My name is Carl Wringler.<br>
                          N: Do you mind if I call you C.W.?<br>
                          C: Sure. I’m on facebook. I’m actually on my way to Nashville. I’m a singer/songwriter.<br>
                          H: Me too.<br>
                          C: Everyone’s a singer/songwriter…<br>
                          N: I’m trying to find out where this Sunset Symphony is.<br>
                          C: Are you just going on a journey?<br>
                          H: It’s just life. I play guitar. I play piano. I play drums. I do whatever. I do life.<br>
                          C: That’s awesome man. I have some talent.<br>
                          H: Yeah, you have some talent, and then you life. You talent, then me talent, and then we life. Everyone is talenting and everyone is lifing. I’m just high. I’m feeling just fine. I’m feeling just life. That’s how fucking life is.<br>
                          N: It is.<br>
                          C: Were we smoking pot?<br>
                          N: No, it’s in the parking garage over there. You want to go smoke there?<br>
                          C: Will you let me?<br>
                          N: Yeah its life. All we’re trying to do is smoke some weed.<br>
                          H: I don’t know. Smoking weed is pretty fucking ridiculous…<br>
                          C: Didn’t I bump into y’all a little while ago?<br>
                          N: We have no idea where we’re going. We’ve been trying to find this…<br>
                          C: Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!<br>
                          N: He can’t walk.<br>
                          C: C’mon dude.<br>
                          N: Do you know where the Sunset Symphony is?<br>
                          C: We’ll find it.<br>
                          N: Be our guide. Hudson, get up off the rocks. We got a lot more to learn about life.<br>
                          C: Now if at anytime I become a hindrance, feel free to ask me to leave.<br>
                          N: Dude, everything is life. Not a problem. Hudson, it’s times to go. Throw the stone in the river. That’s life. Down on the ground…<br>
                           <br>
                           C.W. begins singing to himself while we walk.<br>
                            <br>
                            N: Lay it down C.W.<br>
                            C: Well, I got off work about an hour ago<br>
                            Man, it was a hectic day<br>
                            With all the hours that I put in<br>
                            I wonder if it’s worth the change<br>
                            Oh, from 9 to 5, six days a week<br>
                            They got me as your average Joe<br>
                            But when the weekend rolls around, don’t knock me babe<br>
                            I throw it all away, and I become a…<br>
                            Honky tonk animal, I got that step and that slide<br>
                            There ain’t no work, and I just got paid, and you can call me Mr. Right<br>
                            I’m a devil let loose, so let’s get busy<br>
                            The kid’s a serious fool<br>
                            Who’s been diagnosed with a terminal case<br>
                            Of that honky tonk attitude<br>
                            N: You know we have a guitar in the car too.<br>
                            C: No you don’t!<br>
                            N: You play guitar?<br>
                            C: Do I!<br>
                            N: Alright, then let’s get the guitar too.<br>
                            C: No you don’t! Shut the fuck up! You’re like Jesus! I really am a singer/songwriter on my way to Nashville. You’re fixing to find that out! You must think I’m bullshitting!<br>
                            N: I don’t think you’re bullshitting.<br>
                            C: Man, Jesus loves me! That is so cool. You think I’m bullshitting! Hudson, get your ass over here! Ah, fuck it. Lead the way…Let me ask you something, do you believe in Jesus?<br>
                            N: He was a good dude, but I wouldn’t say I’m a Christian.<br>
                            C: Let’s not talk about it then. Where are we going?<br>
                            N: The car is parked in the garage over there.<br>
                            C (addressing a black man strumming away in front of the fountain of the park the boys started their day in): Is it cool to play some music over here?<br>
                            G: You can play all day long!<br>
                            N: Cool, thanks.<br>
                            C: We could make some serious money, you and me. I’m telling you. Tomorrow…<br>
                             <br>
                             In Garage:<br>
                              <br>
                              N: Just find the keys. I think they’re underneath all this shit.<br>
                              C: Just gimme the guitar man. Gotta get my head right to smoke.<br>
                              N: Well, the weed’s not here. But we got the guitar. Hell yeah.<br>
                              H: Everything is life. What are we doing? It’s life.<br>
                              N: Where is my ukulele?<br>
                              H: The other car.<br>
                              N: I guess we’ll just sing…Hey C.W., I can’t find the joint. Want to just smoke a bowl?<br>
                              C (stops playing abruptly): Yes. (after a brief pause, picks guitar back up) Do you remember this one? (starts playing, then stops after a moments) Oh, I don’t remember?<br>
                              N (hands C.W. the bowl): Maybe this will help.<br>
                              C: Hey man, do you think you could help a brother out, throw me a bone for the road or something? Don’t act like you don’t got none. I already know you do.<br>
                              N: What, you want some weed?<br>
                              C: You got anymore of those shrooms? Huh?<br>
                              N: You trying to trip right now?<br>
                              C: Yeah bro.<br>
                              N: I’m smoking you up right now, yo. But you can have the rest of Hudson’s shake. You can open the bag you know.<br>
                              C: Will you hook me up with some bud? C’mon homeboy.<br>
                              N: I’m smoking you up right now.<br>
                              C: What’s the big deal? Why you laughing? What did I do?<br>
                              N: I’m just sketched out having this much shit in the car.<br>
                              C: Well, what are we going to do now?<br>
                              N: Well, we’re going to finish smoking this bowl-<br>
                              C: Let’s do what we’re going to do! We can’t sit here and be scared.<br>
                              N: I feel like there are ways to be smart about it.<br>
                              C: Let’s go make music buddy. I’ll carry the guitar. Let’s go! Are we going or not?<br>
                              H: The thing is I know exactly what is going on right now.<br>
                               <br>
                               In the park…<br>
                                <br>
                                H: But everybody is an idiot. Being an idiot is life.<br>
                                C: C’mon man, you didn’t find that funny?<br>
                                H: But the thing is like you think I’m an idiot and I think you’re an idiot.<br>
                                N: Can I get a witness, C.W.?<br>
                                H: I’m sober.<br>
                                N: You should probably not get run over by that horse. Are you feeling those mushrooms yet C.W.? C.W.? You’re fucking tripping out.<br>
                                H: What the fuck is that? Like is that a squirrel? By the way, I’m perfectly sober.<br>
                                N: That makes sense because you’re not playing any music.<br>
                                H: What do you want to listen to?<br>
                                C: Whatever you got to play man.<br>
                                N: You’re still trying to figure out what you’re doing.<br>
                                C: No I’m not.<br>
                                N: Hudson is. Hudson’s a fucking idiot. You know how much of a fucking idiot he is.<br>
                                C: We all are. It’s who we are.<br>
                                N: This is a perfect example of why I’m an idiot. I left the other ukulele in the car and now I have to listen to this mother fucker play.<br>
                                H: What are we even doing right now?<br>
                                N: It’s life. It’s life. The music festival is where we should be, but no one knows where that is.<br>
                                H: Everything about life is life no matter what life is.<br>
                                C (precedes words with incoherent grumbling): Hand me the guitar. (Can’t remember song, starts over and stops at same place several times.) I don’t know man.<br>
                                N: You do though, C.W. You do know. We know you know it.<br>
                                C: Do you think you can play this?<br>
                                N: I can try…(His fingers groovy, but he can’t keep a continuous rhythm. Eventually, he revert to chords to fill the air) I have no idea what I’m playing right now. But there’s only so many notes you can play…<br>
                                H: I’m getting kind of worried man.<br>
                                N (while playing): Why are you worried? You never worry about anything.<br>
                                H: I’m not worried about anything.<br>
                                N: There you go…<br>
                                 <br>
                                 Nick finally gets in a groove and sings a song.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  N: Life man. That’s what I’m trying to say.<br>
                                  C (with childlike enthusiasm): Alright gimme the guitar!<br>
                                            Well I like a big girl to hold me tight<br>
                                                        Keep me warm in the middle of the night<br>
                                                                    So mama if you’re out there looking for fun<br>

                                                                                            Oh big girls out there need loving too<br>
                                                                                            H (interrupting the song): This is literally life.      <br>
                                                                                                        Don’t you worry mama don’t you cry<br>

C.W. starts yelling to himself. The only phrase that can be deciphered through the wind, plane, and trolley is “I’m a general!” Overcome with fear, no longer willing to hold the weight of the guitar like a statue while I try to find something to hold mine, I leave the park, to rid myself of the object that can only be that.<br>

But that’s not what I’m about though. What you’re trying to do is life, but that’s not my life. I don’t know what I’m doing. But I’m sober right now. You realize that? I literally could do whatever the fuck I wanted to do. But now that I’ve come out of it, I don’t know what I want to do. Do I want to go to New Orleans to meet up those three other people? I don’t even know who the fuck they are. Who are they? Like Heather’s pretty hot, but she’s really not that hot. Julia is pretty hot.<br>

Without health, you can’t have life. My dad always told me that shit. My parents are so fucking great. I love my parents so much.

I’m happy to do this shit with you man. It’s so fucking beautiful. The fact that we are brought here and made- that’s a fucking horse dude!<br>

Nothing is supposed to make sense. People want to see you connecting with your life. People don’t care how fast you can play guitar as long as you’re communicating with yourself. What I am building is myself, and as long as I’m building myself than I’ll be fine. Nothing has to make sense. Nothing has to make sense, as long as it makes sense to you, as long as I can die on my own terms. Everything is making sense.<br>

The two arrive just in time for national anthem. Then arrives non-descript Dixie symphony, the themes of a river sorcerer, the marvelous Twain!

                                                                                                                                N: So many journeys.<br>
                                                                                                                                H: I want to lie down…I was worried about what I would be like when I was sober, but its just life now dude. How life are we?<br>
                                                                                                                                N: You should get Julia to design you a tattoo.<br>
                                                                                                                                H: Julia is very good at what she does. She’s good at being hot. That’s what she is. That’s her. That’s Julia. She just does her own thing, and Heather sort of follows her around and does a lot of what Julia does. Julia is also very much consumed by the task of creating self-worth. She spends just as much energy being hot as she does posting pictures of her being hot. All of what she does is making other people realize things about her. I love her for it, but it’s life. And I do what I do, while there’s probably a lot of things you could say about me that I couldn’t even begin to say about myself. At the end of the day though I’d still bone the shit out of her.<br>
                                                                                                                                N: Do what you do.<br>
                                                                                                                                H: Story time…That’s also why I really like improvisation/mimicking.  Acting is the greatest form of imitation.<br>
                                                                                                                                N: Happiness?<br>
                                                                                                                                H: No acting. It’s just learning.<br>
                                                                                                                                N: Don’t you learn before you act? Acting is the knowledge, the final product.<br>
                                                                                                                                H: I’ve always loved life man. Always been a big fan. Life has always been good, always has been always will be. Everything is my parents. Everything is true. Just like everything you’ve told me.<br>
                                                                                                                                N: What have I really told you though?<br>
                                                                                                                                H: That’s the whole point. It’s all true.<br>
                                                                                                                                N: But something being true doesn’t give you the will to do. Okay, it’s true, but now what do you do with that understanding? How do you get that truth out of you? What is the question?<br>
                                                                                                                                H: What?<br>
                                                                                                                                N: No, ‘What is the question?’ is the answer to ‘What is the question?’<br>
