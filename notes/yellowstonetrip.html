                <p>We followed the gravel path that bordered the meandering stream.<br>
                 <br>
                 H: Are either of you guys tripping yet?<br>
                 J: No.<br>
                 N: It hasn’t been that long.<br>
                 H: How long does it usually take?<br>
                 N: I don’t know, forty-five minutes?<br>
                 H: Really? Well, I’m going to trip out watch me now!<br>
                 J: I wonder if we should continue walking down this river. It seems like it’s going to continue to be surrounded by shit.<br>
                 N: Nature’s toilet…Let’s smoke a bowl.<br>
                 H: Let’s go to Pink Mountain- or fucking Purple Mountain.<br>
                 J: If one of you wants to drive go ahead. I’m not going to be the one that’s driving.<br>
                 H: Well, I can’t drive.<br>
                 N: I’m good.<br>
                 J: Well, we’ll walk back down the way we came and see how we feel. If we’re tripping really hard, then we can continue to walk up the river that way. I’m pretty sure the river goes both ways.<br>
                 H: Well, we do!<br>
                  <br>
                  The three stumble upon the woodland creature kangaroo court. Hudson lies down to rest his head on the log in the center of the circle. He crosses his arms and puts each of his hands in the pocket opposite its side.  He erupts into laughter. Gradually, his laughing subsides to mimic hiccups. <br>
                   <br>
                   J: Hudson, you know what you look like? Someone from an insane asylum.<br>
                   H: Well, isn’t everything just one big fucking joke, huh?<br>
                    <br>
                    After this initial bout of sarcasm, Hudson breaks out into uproarious, seemingly uncontrollable laughter.<br>
                     <br>
                     J: Well, fuck me Hudson. I wish I was tripping that much.<br>
                     N: What is going on right now? What are you seeing dude?<br>
                     H: Nothing.<br>
                     N: That’s such a Hudson answer.<br>
                     H: Oh my god, like what the fuck is going on?<br>
                     N: You’re tripping B, what do you think? Here we are.<br>
                     H: Oh my god, what the fuck is going on right now?<br>
                     N: What do you mean?<br>
                     H: I don’t know!<br>
                     J: You’re acting like the specimen of some science experiment. Looks like he laughs for five to ten minutes then stops.<br>
                     N: And forgets what happened. This is life dude! This is life!<br>
                     H: What just happened?<br>
                     N: That’s happened to me before. I mean the uncontrollable laughter at nothing part and the not forgetting what happened after it. Remember Whitey’s Civic that he got from the drug dealer? With the seat covers that hid the back pocket on the front seats!<br>
                     J: And the removable air conditioner console!<br>
                     N: And the roll up windows! I’ve never seen a car that screamed sketchy more. It was such a dumb idea to buy it. Anyone to buy it is going to be automatically searched if pulled over. And then we were parked with it in front of the candy shop at the Mobil waiting for Colin one night and all of sudden the utter sketchiness hit me and I could not stop laughing for the life of me for ten minutes straight, even though its conspicuousness would have been rather inconspicuous if Whitey hadn’t pointed out all the features.<br>
                     J: But we should go. Even if we just walk around the woods on Purple Mountain. It’s too populated for us right now. Too many roads. Hudson you should drink some water. Imagine your car running without any oil.<br>
                     H: Why?<br>
                     J: That’s a fucking annoying word. Because you’ll forget to drink otherwise.<br>
                     H: I am tripping fucking hardcore right now.<br>
                     J: And that’s why you’re going to be the object of this study here.<br>
                     H: What happened? What are you talking about?<br>
                     N: How long into the future do you think it will be before people start having sex with aliens?<br>
                     J: I think a better question would be: How soon after we find aliens do you think it will be before we start having sex with them?<br>
                     H: Do you think we can fuck bacteria?<br>
                     N: Will there ever not be life?<br>
                     J: I think we should get to the mountain if we’re ever going to get there.<br>
                     H: I’m fucking tripping.<br>
                      <br>
                      Nick begins to hear his heart pounding through his chest and it is in rhythm with my footsteps.<br>
                       <br>
                       N (while driving): Just tell me left or right.<br>
                       J: I think you just went down a one-way road.<br>
                       N: Well, how the hell else are you supposed to get out of that?<br>
                       J: There’s a turn around.<br>
                       N: But that’s muddy, and this worked out.<br>
                       H: Don’t run into anything.<br>
                       N:  Except Purple Mountain.<br>
                       …<br>
                       N: You ready to smoke some purple?<br>
                       H: No, no, no.<br>
                       N: Take off all your clothes Hudson.<br>
                       J: No don’t do that.<br>
                       N: Goddam, what happened to you? You can’t even drink water now.<br>
                       J: He can’t stop laughing.<br>
                       N (laughing): Now I can’t drink water. Oh man, this weed is so purple!<br>
                       H: Where should I put this water?<br>
                       N: In this backpack, much like the one you had until your car got robbed.<br>
                       J: Smoke this. It will help.<br>
                       H: Hope it doesn’t rain.<br>
                       J: Did you repack this bowl or is this the same one as this morning?<br>
                       H: I’m literally going insane right now.<br>
                       N: We all are. That’s why we’re having an awesome time.<br>
                       J: I guarantee that you won’t be dead or we’ll all be dead. Do you have a different lighter? This one’s been going out a lot recently.<br>
                       N: This is the different lighter.<br>
                       H: I gotta get my wits about me.<br>
                       N: Purple flowers. The namesake, right here. Ah, I left my camera a second time. Should me smoke the flowers?<br>
                       J: I knew where this was going right after the purple part.<br>
                       H: I can’t keep my fucking spit out of my mouth.<br>
                       N: Yo Hudson, you’re just the perfect metaphor for Hudson.<br>
                       H: Is that the epitome of a high statement?<br>
                       N: We’re going furtherer and furtherer!<br>
                       H: We should probably not be here.<br>
                       N: Look, those trees are laid in a triangle. The ultimate symbol…<br>
                       H: There are spiders everywhere.<br>
                       N: Where?<br>
                       H: All over your back.<br>
                       N: Well get them off.<br>
                       H: We should go.<br>
                       N: But where’s the spider?<br>
                       J: There’s no spider.<br>
                       N: Ok, there’s no spider.<br>
                       H: I’m on LS-fucking-D.<br>
                       N: Me too! Smoke some weed dude. Come on.<br>
                        <br>
                        Engravings in logs: Symmetry, but a type of which we’ve never seen, shapes new to us.<br>
                         <br>
                         N: I’m looking at all the other details that point to the same thing…<br>
                         …<br>
                         N: I literally don’t feel anything.<br>
                         H: There are literally like infinite mosquitoes.<br>
                         N (rustling through pockets): I got that fucking pen we found. That was forever ago. (referring to a meat thermometer he found by the river and which he thought he could use to say he found his deepest desire: a pen that could write you exactly what you’re feeling)<br>
                         J: Alright, let’s get to the top.<br>
                         N: Should we smoke again? Wait we don’t even know where we are.<br>
                         H: The mosquitoes are everywhere.<br>
                         N: I still can’t see them.<br>
                         J: I can now. They’re all over your hat.<br>
                         N: So that’s why we couldn’t get beyond this point before, why you could see the bugs and I couldn’t. I can’t see the shit on my own head…How can you see how you see? Especially when it’s got bugs…Look how young these trees look…<br>
                         H: How do you see how you see! That’s crazy as fuck…is going on right now! How do you see how you see! Holy shit, I’m going to die right now.<br>
                         N: How could you not see that? Look at the river down there. There’s always a road between us and the river.<br>
                         J: Let’s go up.<br>
                         …<br>
                         J: You want to smoke? We haven’t had a good spot like this in a while, and who knows when we’ll get one again.<br>
                         N: So pack a bowl. Pull down the windows. Fucking purple on fucking purple.<br>
                         H: No, where do we find the purple? That’s the point of this journey.<br>
                         N: Finding purple is discovering that there is no purple.<br>
                         H: Yo, I don’t really care to smoke. Let’s go up. These mosquitoes are bugging me and kind of ruining my trip. I understand they’re part of my trip, but like…life is killing me. Oh my god, what are we doing? Is that the river? I am shitting out of my fucking mind right now. If I look at one thing I’ll probably die. I’M TRIPPING BALLS!!!<br>
                         N: Look at all we’ve accomplished so far.<br>
                         H: This is fucking crazy. What’s that, wind? It’s fucking nuts. Ah, I’m so cool. I’m tripping balls so strong.<br>
                         N: Look at literally how far we can fucking see. This is crazy.<br>
                         H: The sunshine and the oh my god…<br>
                         N: Do you see the face down there? In the river basin? With all the tributaries pouring in over the head like veins, only of Mother Earth…Or just think about how much activity is going on before us, like in only the sliver front of our eyes.<br>
                         H: Wow I’m tripping balls. This is so epic. I could literally sit here forever. Looks like the suns going to come out again.<br>
                         N: And then another cloud’s going to go by.<br>
                         H: And then another cloud’s going to go bye.<br>
                         N: I feel like all these cloud’s shadows.<br>
                         H: I feel like sunshine, the fucking craziness.<br>
                         N: I mean like I feel like the sky imprinted upon the ground we’re looking at.<br>
                         H: This is so fucking like life right now. This is so fucking life right now. This is life. This is what smoking on Purple Mountain is all about.<br>
                         N: It’s because the sun is so high above the clouds.<br>
                         H: The rolling hills and the rolling skies…I can see the sunshine come out of the fucking clouds. WHOOOOAAAAA!!! How do you see what you see!!!<br>
                         N: You’re fucking tripping. NO ONE CAN FUCKING HEAR ME ANYMORE!!! The sun’s coming out. This is awesome. Unless you’re a vampire.<br>
                         H: I see it, I see it. Like all the things you’re trying to say are like ‘I’m tripping fucking balls’ and I’m tripping fucking balls. That’s what life is: Everyone’s tripping fucking balls except for trying to explain it to each other. It’s fucking dumb. Let’s trip balls and keep going.<br>
                         N: Miles and miles contained in one dot. Lots of them. Everyone’s got their own picture of the trees.<br>
                         H: Am I being a retard? Sorry. As long as I’m not bringing down society. Can you just tell me what the fuck is happening?<br>
                         J: In multiple ways. You just want to live to see tomorrow.<br>
                         N: The point of this is to keep lifing.<br>
                         H: You guys are going to fucking smoke?<br>
                         N: We’ve been smoking this entire fucking trip, we’re not going to smoke now?<br>
                         J: Hudson, there’s nothing to do. How do you not want to smoke? And you have to admit, we need to admire the view.<br>
                         H: We need to get to the top.<br>
                         J: There might not even be a top.<br>
                         N: We literally saw a sign for Purple Mountain and swung our car around.<br>
                         H: What are we doing right now?<br>
                         N: I fucking love you dawg! You’re the best.<br>
                         J: We’re climbing to the top.<br>
                         H: Is the wind in that water bottle?<br>
                         N: Aren’t you glad we packed so much purple.<br>
                         J: Really glad. I’ll pack one.<br>
                         N: You’re always tripping. That’s the point Hudson. So many layers that you don’t even realize until they pass you.<br>
                         H: Infinity, dude.<br>
                         N: That’s the point. No longer are we ninety degrees to infinity.<br>
                         H: THIS IS SO FUCKING COOL!! Holy shit.<br>
                         N: Now it’s this.<br>
                         H: You see that shit? Oh my god, I need to have sex right now.<br>
                         N: We’re miles away from anyone. You’re so lifing hard right now.<br>
                         J: You’re rebooting to version 1.1, Hudson. <br>
                         H: Where’s that wind?<br>
                         N: We go for the hand sanitizer, Hudson goes right for the dirt.<br>
                         J: It’s very innocent of Hudson.<br>
                         N: Coming of age. Hope I find my lighter.<br>
                         J: Oh no.<br>
                         H: This is so cool. Everything in life is happening. Fucking Joo Young Maeng, fucking oh my god. This is just life.<br>
                         J: Still haven’t found a lighter?<br>
                         N: It’s somewhere. What you see is what you do?<br>
                         H: Everything is fucking one! I’m so sweet. I want to rape shit.<br>
                         N: Did you just give birth to your football?<br>
                         H: What is life?<br>
                         N: You’re such a dumbass.<br>
                         H: Yeah I swing with that dirt.<br>
                         J: I think we should turn around by 4:20.<br>
                         N: Well then, let’s meet the frontier. Hudson, we’re going!<br>
                         H: Are you pissing?!<br>
                         N: Yeah I’m pissing. We’re going.<br>
                         H: (turning to go piss): Oh shit.<br>
                         N: You’re such a fucking dumbass. The second you say something’s a bad idea you turn around and do it.<br>
                          <br>
                          The three, able to see completely the snaking pattern that the trail has become, decide to go straight up the mountain and use the trail as steps.<br>
                           <br>
                           H: Do you know where we left off?<br>
                           J: I left a football there. If we don’t find it, we’re dead.<br>
                           N: There’s fucking sand dunes! Why are you dropping your things? Now we just have to pick them up again on the way back.<br>
                           H: It’s symbolic, dude.<br>
                           N: It’s very symbolic. You don’t need any of that? Your water?<br>
                           H: I have my wits about me.<br>
                           N: As long as you got those. Are all my things attached to my bag? I feel like a blob is about to fall out.<br>
                           …<br>
                           N: We just climbed. Look at what that all became.<br>
                           H: The whole point of going to the top is to be able to go back.<br>
                           N: In the back of my mind at least.<br>
                           H: If you don’t ever go back, you can never reflect on it, and then why have hiked up in the first place if you’re not going to be able to think about what that hiking was? There and back again. That’s what a trip is.<br>
                           N: Not to come down…But you’re right, you’ll never know what it was unless you go back to the same point of reference. Otherwise there’s no constant to compare your new self to. Otherwise you’re still tripping.<br>
                           H: That’s why tripping is so fucking important. So you can come back.<br>
                           N: Nah…<br>
                           H: I’m fucking ready. I’m fucking ready to bring back life.<br>
                           N: What are you going to bring back?<br>
                           H: Look at the acorns and shit and the pinecones on the fucking trees. It’s about everything.<br>
                           N: That’s what I meant. How can you bring back everything?<br>
                           H: It’s no big deal.<br>
                           N: Well, we made it to the top of the mountain and didn’t know what the fuck we were doing. We would reflect on how we didn’t know what the fuck we were doing while we were doing what we didn’t know. And we’re still on top of Purple Mountain high on LSD.<br>
                           H: This is so fucking life. How the fuck is life happening around us? We’re just fucking life? I think the whole point of life is that it intersects.<br>
                           N: That’s how it exists.<br>
                           H: This hike is like a perfect metaphor for life. But then, everything is everything, so why shouldn’t it be.<br>
                           N: Isn’t ‘everything is everything’ a metaphor? Isn’t ‘everything’ a metaphor for everything? Everything isn’t in that word. ‘Everything’ stands in for everything.<br>
                           H: But a metaphor’s like a connection.<br>
                           N: Where there shouldn’t be one…Our whole life has been a metaphor for tripping on Purple Mountain.<br>
                           H: A metaphor for a crap movie. That’s what our fucking lives are.<br>
                           N: Yeah man, everyone’s making a movie, because everyone has a mind to make.<br>
                           H: We should leave something here.<br>
                           J: We could make something.<br>
                           N: Should we leave the needle?<br>
                           H: Wait, the needle was from the very beginning, right?<br>
                           N: The needle was when I knew I was fucking tripping. The spirally thermometer part fell off the top, but know its an open capsule.<br>
                           H: Someone made this to have a meaning and now we’re giving it more meaning.<br>
                           N: That’s why we can’t bring it with us. Giving something meaning doesn’t make it ours.<br>
                           H: I thought that’s what meaning is?<br>
                           N: It’s an attempt to try and make it yours, definitely. How would you gauge your inner temperature right now?<br>
                           H: What’s your favorite temperature?<br>
                           N: Different question, but I confuse the inside with outside every now and then, so ninety. If it’s ninety, then I’m awesome.<br>
                           H: Mel asked me that question once. That’s when I realized that I didn’t have a favorite temperature- or that I didn’t think about temperature enough to have a favorite temperature. She assumed I would have one though. I guess my life is so simple it’s beyond assumptions.<br>
                           N: All she assumed was that your environment would affect your personality.<br>
                           H: I still don’t have a fucking answer.<br>
                           N: It’s just exactly what the air is. But why do you need this answer? How is having a favorite temperature going to make you a better person?<br>
                           H: Should I take more acid?<br>
                           N: We don’t have anymore…You can never leave anything behind: That’s why we can leave the needle! Whoever comes up here will gain something that we gained, or something of it…What could it mean?<br>
                           J: We’re the ones that gave it meaning.<br>
                           N: Exactly.<br>
                           J: Alright Hudson, leave it.<br>
                           H: You can’t see something and know it. It’s the one fucking law. I love you fucking guys. Give me a hug.<br>
                           N: You would have never made it to the top.<br>
                           J: How do we get down? That way?<br>
                           H: No it’s definitely that way. I’m not that tripping.<br>
                           N: We’re about to slide off the edge.<br>
                           H: Can I just stay here for life? I understand why people climb mountains now.<br>
                           N: I’m covered in dust! We’re in the sand dunes of time! I can’t stop touching the ground.<br>
                           J: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but its 4:20.<br>
                           H: Everything is one.<br>
                           N: So let’s smoke a bowl and turn around. And bring the dust wherever we go.<br>
                           H: I can’t even remember anything!<br>
                           N: The point is you’re not getting your bag back.<br>
                           H: Shit’s gonna work out, bro. It always fucking works out. I’m going to get us back to our car.<br>
                           J: I’m glad you have that confidence.<br>
                           N: Why are you pissing right here?<br>
                           H: Do you see what’s going on in the fucking world right now? We are, uh…yeah. Is this about climbing Purple Mountain…<br>
                           N: Or seeing how far you get…How do you go where you see?<br>
                           H: It’s all about who you go with…I just realized that everyone is their own Hudson.<br>
                           N: You’re so primordial.<br>
                           J: My goal is to get to car.<br>
                           H: This is just like I imagined. This guy is just gone, Joo is trying to get to the car and I have no idea what the fuck is going on. I’m having a moment of clarity right now in my altitude. We are so fucking stupid. This is the perfect group to bring on top Purple Mountain. I love you guys.<br>
                           N: Ah the dust is in my mouth. I can’t help it wherever I go.<br>
                           H: Everything fucking makes sense. Godam it.<br>
                           N: Hudson where are you going?<br>
                           J: If one of us gets separated we’re going to die.<br>
                           H: Maybe this road trip is about me dying. I didn’t tell my parents I was coming back. That’s not my life. I just told them I loved them. That’s all that I could say.<br>
                           N: The point is we’re not finding your bag.<br>
                           H: I have so much change in there though.<br>
                           N: Why are we going? I’m sitting down.<br>
                           H: You need to go there and back again. That’s how you see what you see.<br>
                           N: This is crazy where we are.<br>
                           H: Literally dude, I’m clear. Everything I am is made out of everything that you guys are. I can look in your eyes and see the same person looking up from lane 4, but like a different person.<br>
                           N: It’s all about the past. It’s all about one. One by one to infinity.<br>
                           H: We’re literally living. Who cares about the future?<br>
                           N: You put your bag by the path right? We’ll find your bag. We know what’s going on- because we have no idea what’s going on. Look how far we have become to.<br>
                           …<br>
                           Hiker: I can’t get over how much taller this mountain is than National Park Mountain.<br>
                           N: How tall is this mountain.<br>
                           Hi: Let me pull out my map and check. Where you guys from?<br>
                           N: New York.<br>
                           Hi: What brought you guys out here?<br>
                           N: Travelling…Wilderness…<br>
                           Hi: Ok, so…Purple Mountain is 8400 ft. and National Park Mountain is 7500 ft.<br>
                           N: So what are you doing out here?<br>
                           Hi: Well I’ve been here many a time. I worked here twenty years ago.<br>
                           N: You worked here?<br>
                           Hi: Yeah, it was awesome. But to live out here…I wish I could go back and change…something that happened twenty years ago. How many days are you guys in the park for?<br>
                           N: I think we’re leaving tomorrow…<br>
                           Hi: Ok so, how days have you been in the park?<br>
                           N: We were here yesterday…<br>
                           H: Two nights ago.<br>
                           Hi: So tonight, go to Old Faithful and watch it after sundown.<br>
                           H: After sundown?<br>
                           Hi: After sundown. I don’t think we’ll have a clear sky tonight, but it’s worth it to see Old Faithful go off under the stars. Well guys, enjoy the journey down. There might be a family below me, but I passed them a significant length of time ago. Alright, see ya.<br>
                           …<br>
                           H: Hold on, we just climbed Purple Mountain.<br>
                           J: We did just climb Purple Mountain.<br>
                           H: Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah.<br>
                           N: Still tripping. Yo remember these shiny rocks we saw on the way up?<br>
                           H: I didn’t see those on my way up, but what you see is what you see.<br>
                           N: Purple.<br>
                           H: Did we pass these on the way up? Were we tripping fucking acid? Purple Mountain is a purple metaphor. We were like: Football here, we’re climbing up.<br>
                           J: What’s your lucky number Hudson?<br>
                           H: There is no lucky number. There’s only one number. The one you bet on. Yo there’s that fucking bend!<br>
                           J: Smoke here? There’s no wind.<br>
                           H: What about the family?<br>
                           J: It’s Purple Mountain. What would they expect?<br>
                           N: Tripping out’s all about…<br>
                           J: Will we ever find the truth?<br>
                           N: Yeah! Think about how much blacker we’ve made Marley since the beginning of the trip. But it’s the unstainable bowl: because everything that touches it can never be a stain.<br>
                           H: I just saw myself with a bunch of…I honestly…I’m good, I’m not even gonna explain it…It’s like not even…<br>
                           N: It’s Purple Mountain, dude!<br>
                           J: Oh, I forgot. We didn’t finish this from smoking it at the top.<br>
                           N: I think it got too windy. But I can never remember how much weed we actually smoked.<br>
                           J: Spoken like a true pothead.<br>
                           N: I just pass the bowl whenever I fucked it up right…The point of you-<br>
                           H: Doesn’t matter. Oh my god, I’m so glad that I’m here with you now.<br>
                           N: What else would we be doing?<br>
                           H: Dude! There is infinite things that we could be doing.<br>
                           N: It’s all about seeing your face in the matter.<br>
                           H: There is literally infinite things that any of us could be doing right now. <br>
                           J: But we would definitely be doing this, Hudson.<br>
                           H: All the things that normally ground me, like science and stuff, are just a figment to me right now. They’re all just like, that doesn’t hold true, that doesn’t hold true…<br>
                           N: What isn’t true?<br>
                           H; I feel like everything I used to think is not true now. Like woa…Like all the shit I used to see on Bill Nye and shit.<br>
                           J: Well, that shit’s still cool, Hudson.<br>
                           H: Well yeah it is but it’s not.<br>
                           N: What isn’t the purpose of this?<br>
                           H: What are we doing? Oh, nevermind…Everything’s a function! Ah! That’s what I was talking about that day, that was so ill!<br>
                           J: See Hudson, that’s the purpose that they serve. They’re all a function of time.<br>
                           H: If you put something in the function of time and temperature, anything can happen.<br>
                           J: Fucking trip man…<br>
                           H: Ah! It’s like perfect: Purple Fucking Mountain!<br>
                           N: But it is!<br>
                           H: It was meant to happen, dude. I’m fucking sober right now. But it’s not a cycle. Everything is one. I’m always sober and I’m always tripping. Right now I’m tripping, but I’m like…<br>
                           N: It’s like crazy how you can take one step…<br>
                           H: The entire time I’ve had my wits about me…<br>
                           N: Yeah, dude.<br>
                           H: But like at the same time I didn’t…How long does it take us to get down the mountain? Like an hour?<br>
                           J: No. It is too far of a hike for us to do it in an hour.<br>
                           H: Guarantee we can get this done- I’m done with this. The point is that life is a function of everything.<br>
                           J: Oh sorry. I keep forgetting you don’t want it and keep handing it to you<br>
                           H: I keep forgetting that I hit it.<br>
                           J: Shows how high you are.<br>
                           H: We are such potheads. We are so fucking stupid. I am not sober at all.<br>
                           J: No we’re definitely not.<br>
                           H: I am not sober at all! I am fucking tripping on acid. Ha-Ha, I just said ‘on fucking acid.’<br>
                           N: You are…I wonder why the dead trees stand taller than the green?<br>
                           H: What are you going for?<br>
                           N: What are you talking about?<br>
                           H: I’m fucking- I’m fucking- I was- I was- fucking- um- ohmygod- what the hell?<br>
                           J: This has been a ridiculous trip so far. Think about where we started.<br>
                           N: We just grabbed our wits about us at random intervals.<br>
                           H: Our-our-our lives are retarded.<br>
                           N: That’s a beautiful statement.<br>
                           H: And we’re about to go back to Salt Lake- to civilization designed…Do you guys want to get going, or do you wanna…<br>
                           N: Did you take a picture of the face?<br>
                           J: Yeah, I took a picture of the face.<br>
                           N: Born in time!<br>
                           H: That’s where it started.<br>
                           N: Yo, didn’t even think to grab water.<br>
                           …<br>
                           J: Remember we were looking at these carvings? I think it might be insects.<br>
                           H: Yeah I think it might be worms. Everything’s so different. Like literally this whole time I’ve been like what the fuck is going on.<br>
                           N: There’s nothing to figure out, when everything is…<br>
                           J: Yo let’s try and figure out if we stopped here before.<br>
                           N: Fucking fucking right.<br>
                           …<br>
                           N: The point is like if you’re tripping on LSD all the time, then why would you bomb Iraq?<br>
                           …<br>
                           N: This tree is like breathing right now. It’s really trippy.<br>
                           H: This tree is trippy as fuck!!<br>
                           N: Oh my god, this tree is awesome! This is a serious carving. From head to toe.<br>
                           H: It’s so fucking good dude. It’s so good.<br>
                           …<br>
                           H: The point is that at first I didn’t think so, but I actually am a fucking dumbass.<br>
                           N; I’m glad we smoked mad purple on Purple Mountain.<br>
                           H: I’m sure I’m pretty ridiculous right now…I figured out a lot of things. That’s where we were, by the way. On top of that. We literally were on top of that. I feel farther along though with you than when we were tripping on shrooms. Well, tripping on shrooms, I didn’t really know what tripping was.<br>
                           …<br>
                           N: How do any of us know anything?<br>
                           H: Wait, we’re going back to the campground? What have we been doing again?<br>
                           N: We just hiked Purple Mountain?<br>
                           H: I know that dumbass, but like…we were looking for a river?<br>
                           J: That was earlier today, wasn’t it?<br>
                           N: The great white…Yeah dude, you took a lot of acid.<br>
                           H: So you remember the river?<br>
                           N: Yeah, we were wandering.<br>
                           J: What was our campsite again?<br>
                           N: 239. See? I have a good memory.<br>
                           H: Yo, we’re such Gs.<br>
                           N: Rated G.<br>
                           J: Jesus.<br>
                           N: Gs are us.<br>
                           H: What the fuck happened?<br>
                           N: We didn’t stake it down.<br>
                           H: Of course, we come back to our fucking tent…<br>
                           N: Where’s my camera? Let me take a picture: Team Dumbass.<br>
                           …<br>
                           N: It’s so perfect how ‘Echoes’ opens with a guitar that sounds like dripping water. When you hear a drop of water, you hear it- know it exists- because it lands on a still surface, usually a body of water, so to think of a drop of water is to think of it forming ripples, while the ripples that a drop of water makes on a still pond form the picture of echoes. So it looks we’re really getting to the bottom of the idea now. The music’s pulling our minds underwater, where its all water, where you can barely hear, where a word becomes an echo once it leaves your mouth. The guitar is carrying us through and under it’s painting. (As the lyrics kick in) But now I feel like I just climbed to the top of a mountain and saw a massive explosion sound out light and debris in a ripple effect, like an emerging meteor just landed. But that is the intersection of time. There are literally patterns in the sea…<br>
                            <br>
                            “Strangers passing in the street<br>
                            By chance two separate classes meet<br>
                            And I am you and what I see is me”<br>
                             <br>
                             N: The chorus sounds like it comes at the apex that a surface of water reaches just before it returns a splash to the world that the drop which dampened it came from…And then at the end, the voices, instead of sending the impression of the drop right back like the music, hold on to it, stretch it out, reflect it, make it not so world shattering, make that bounce back in the manner of curves bending around a river, following the surface made by the dropping water… In the breakdown, the slide guitar is the shining surface, the bass is the way down to where its happening…Now we got that dino rock…<br>
                             H: I’m trying to think of who I am though, and I’m like, a…<br>
                             N: Where we you going? What was your question?<br>
                             H: I’m trying to think back to when I was like a- I defined who a person is…Chinese history stuff.<br>
                             N: What about Chinese history?<br>
                             H: Chinese means ‘The Middle’ or ‘The Middle Country’ and I’m like a Middle Person- The Middle Man.<br>
                             J: Did you that the word Chinese is very close to the Korean word for Chinese?<br>
                             N: What is The Middle?<br>
                             J: Nothing. It’s the name of a country.<br>
                             H: Everyone has their own name for it.<br>
                             N: It is…But a middle man for who?<br>
                             H: I don’t know. I feel like I’m in the middle of you two. For me, it’s like this jail between Joo’s logical thinking and your emotional thinking.<br>
                             N: We draw from people. Who we’re around builds who we are.<br>
                             H: Everyone is the middle person for everyone else.<br>
                             J: Yeah.<br>
                             N: You stretch out in either direction.<br>
                             H: And you’re probably thinking the exact same thing, that you’re in the middle of me and Joo.<br>
                             N: But it stretches infinitely.<br>
                             H: Everyone’s just in the middle.<br>
                             N: Because there’s no end.<br>
                             J: No way.<br>
                              <br>
                              We enter the darkest creepiest part of the song, the middle, a swirl of specters, devoid of all instruments.<br>
                               <br>
                               N: Holy shit, remember we saw that Bison. It appeared out of nowhere. It’s in your car now. It was chilling in the meadow, like a baller.<br>
                               H: Like the story says, dude, high school never ends.<br>
                               J: I never understood what bison were. What’s the difference between a bison and a buffalo? Is a bison just a made up animal?<br>
                               N: That could be…This part of the song makes me feel like I’m walking through tall grass and can’t shake the feeling that there’s an animal behind me, crawling through the vines of straw, nor the feeling that this feeling will keep going, that this meadow won’t end.<br>
                               H: Oh man, you’re like so keyed in. I thought this was a different song.<br>
                               N: You’re such like a Hudson.<br>
                               H: I’m going some crazy fucking places.<br>
                               N; The middle.<br>
                               H: Nah, the thing is I always thought I was the center. But the center is very like selfish.<br>
                               N: You’re amidst.<br>
                               H: I was in the middle and it totally made me feel…When I was in the center, I was definitely like a star person, I was intelligent, but everyone’s their own Hudson, and that’s like you know…the thing it was about and I was like, holy shit.<br>
                               N; Yeah man everyone’s so happy on their own<br>
                               H: Yeah, everyone’s like, I’m not the center. I’m in the middle. Of our people’s lives. I’m in the fucking middle! Am I high?<br>
                               N: What are you in the middle of?<br>
                                <br>
                                Dawn begins to rise in the background of the song.<br>
                                 <br>
                                 H: I don’t know. I always thought it was instinctive, that answer. I don’t know. Fuck. It’s fucking crazy.<br>
                                 N: Crazy, dude. We’re literally each drop of air rising up to touch the patterns. Even though the dust has already collected.<br>
                                 H: It doesn’t fucking matter.<br>
                                 N: You’ve got to find yourself, Hudson. Let the river run through you.<br>
                                 H: So pure, dude. So pure.<br>
                                 N: It’s creation. It really broke everything down before to silence, echoes…The things that aren’t even the original found, but once played them with echoes bouncing around. So far out…But things that you can’t see anymore still resonate, it’s very human, very human-<br>
                                 H: Perfect. That was perfect dude.<br>
                                 N: I’m coming up from under the ocean. So I can’t see where I sprouted in the first place.<br>
                                 H: This is where the bass comes in and it’s like a different part of my life now. Flash.<br>
                                 N: And it trails off like the band that came before it. It took its arch. I can only like, I can only like, you’ve got to tell me about your life. Each time that bass kicks in!<br>
                                 H: It’s like a different part of my life dropping down.<br>
                                 N: Each time the bass hits its like I’m trying to hit the brake and keep from swerving out but you know you’re going so fast you can only stall…The echoes of the present building over one another towards the center, crumbling under their own weight to make a middle way. It’s so groovy dude. It’s like folk. It’s like funk…<br>
                                 H: It’s so infused with life. All the influences come crashing back.<br>
                                 N: The piano and guitar breathe in and out as echoes of one another and then end up taking on a life of their own. They’re echoes only if you don’t listen closely.<br>
                                 J: I’m not tripping as hard as I was when we were up the mountain<br>
                                 H: What the fuck just happened?<br>
                                 N: The fuck that’s ever happening when you’re tripping out.<br>
                                 H: Oh my god, what the fuck just happened?<br>
                                 N: It’s all happening<br>
                                 H: I feel so tired.<br>
                                 N: Is it raining hard?<br>
                                 J: It’s been going off and on this entire time.<br>
                                 (Beeping phone can be heard in the background following this sentence)<br>
                                 N: Wanna keep listening to music?<br>
                                 H: What do you want to do?<br>
                                 (One minute of silence.)<br>
                                 J: I’m making a fire.<br>
                                 N: I’m going to listen to music. Who’d you just put on?<br>
                                 H: Pink Floyd.<br>
                                 N: It doesn’t sound like Pink Floyd. What album is it?<br>
                                 H: A Momentary Lapse of Reason.<br>
                                 N: Oh, so that’s why it didn’t sound like them.<br>
                                 H: Oh my god, a momentary lapse!<br>
                                 N: Of what?<br>
                                 H: Of reason.<br>
                                 N: Of Waters.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  After not even a song, Hudson and Nick leave the car to help Joo make a fire.<br>
                                   <br>
                                   H: Is civilization based on not having any mosquitoes? Like how come there aren’t any in New York City?<br>
                                   N: You could argue quite the opposite.<br>
                                   J: Yeah there are!<br>
                                   H: I lived in New York City and did not get bit by one mosquito.<br>
                                   N: You never got to live there in the summer.<br>
                                   H: Yeah, uh, exactly.<br>
                                   N: You’re such a dumbass.<br>
                                   H: Thank you for fucking telling me that! I’m a fucking dumbass! Like what the fuck! I realized- I know I realized at some point that I am a fucking dumbass. I’m a fucking dumbass, man!<br>
                                   N: Yo Hudson, pop the trunk.<br>
                                   H: This guy has the keys. Like what the fuck are we doing with the keys.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    They scrounge for firewood in the back of Hudson’s car.<br>
                                     <br>
                                     J: We have pretty shitty firewood.<br>
                                     H: Everything we have is shit, by the way.<br>
                                     N: What?<br>
                                     H: Everything we have is shit. There’s just like so much random shit. We’re literally going to stumble our way to San Francisco.<br>
                                     J: I think before we leave the park we’ll dump a lot of shit into a garbage bin.<br>
                                     N: Nah, c’mon dude, we’ll do it in San Francisco.<br>
                                     H: Yeah, dude let’s do it in San Francisco.<br>
                                     J: I don’t really want to get to San Franciso in a moving garbage bin.<br>
                                     N: Ha! It’s your fucking car!<br>
                                     H: I fucking love this car. I love this trip. I love you.<br>
                                     N: I love you.<br>
                                     H: Yeah, exactly, it’s like the LSD. Fuck. I love cooking. I fucking love cooking, dude. I never loved cooking until this road trip.<br>
                                     J: Yeah, we cooked out.<br>
                                     N: Climbing up Purple Mountain, man.<br>
                                     H: Yeah, climbing up Purple Mountain. I’m re-entering life, it feels like. I’m getting my wits about me.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      After helping, Hudson and Nick return to the car and where they left off in A Momentary Lapse of Reason.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       N: It’s like it’s own like dream, you know? Figuring it out as it goes. That’s why I love this fucking road trip.<br>
                                       H: Figuring it out as it goes. But I’m glad it’s been with you.<br>
                                       N: Glad we got to figure it out together and climb up this mountain. Because we each have our own part. We each ensured that we’d ensure different parts of it. It’s like we’re all just looking after each other. We can just like trip and shit and have nothing happen and it’s all good.<br>
                                       H: We all have our own ways of: oddly tripping.<br>
                                       N: Yeah dude, of course.<br>
                                       H: Dude, it like makes sense that I found my bag. But it also doesn’t make sense that I found my bag.<br>
                                       N: Why doesn’t it make sense? We didn’t even go that far off the trail. We took the shortcut. The trail snaked. It never left. We tracked down the shortest route between two points, what was perpendicular to the trail.<br>
                                       H: You could also go in the other direction<br>
                                       N: Yeah, it’s all just like a downward progression- This song is fucking sick! We should be blazing in the car.<br>
                                       H: Hell yeah we’re blazing in the car. This is “Learning to Fly,” right? Then hell yeah we’re blazing.<br>
                                       N: Joo has the lighter.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Nick goes to fetch Joo.<br>
                                         <br>
                                         N: Yo dude it’s all about the I at the end. That’s what all those hopes and fears boil down to.<br>
                                         H: I love how we all have different interpretations. For me, it’s the circling skies.<br>
                                         N: They boil down to the I. But they keep on circling inside in some strange way to make this inexplicable thing, that’s just in the middle, though the circles are inside it, because the skies keep on circling inside and out until you ask, How can I…Do we have to go back?<br>
                                         H: For me, it’s all about the circles.<br>
                                         N: Which is the I.<br>
                                         H: Yeah but everyone has their own opinion, for everything.<br>
                                         N: That’s what art’s all about. Multiple meanings on the same plane, or playing field. It’s all about what’s in the middle of the object and the perceiver.<br>
                                         H: Yeah, it’s like there’s never that point between the two. Or there’s always the point between the two. Oh my god dude, life is so fucking crazy.<br>
                                         N: It’s crazy how life makes life.<br>
                                         H: Oh my god, acid is so good!<br>
                                         N: Acid is fucking awesome, dude.<br>
                                         H: Acid’s like so fucking pure.<br>
                                         N: It’s man striving towards infinity.<br>
                                         H: It’s great but I only want to trip like one ball when I’m in Vegas. But where’s that Jay-Z shit? Ah, here we go. Parking Lot Pimpin’.<br>
                                         N: This is working out the hotbox.<br>
                                         H: Oh shit dude, I thought our car was on fire.<br>
                                         N: No, your car’s just a mess.<br>
                                         H: A perfect mess.<br>
                                         N: Like every mess.<br>
                                         H: No one has any where close to that experience at Yellowstone! That was life dude!<br>
                                         J: I feel like our last hike should have been that hike. Well, we’ll wake up tomorrow and make a decision then.<br>
                                         H: If I was sober I would have been like, Why the hell am I doing this?<br>
                                         N: Yo, do you guys want to go to L.A. so we can go to Magic Johnson’s Fridays?<br>
                                         H: I want to make a movie where that sentence makes perfect sense.<br>
                                         N: Next Friday? And Fridays is like the best restaurant. It’s all other restaurants put together. It trademarked the word Friday. Fucking A dude. Now they got restaurants all over America.<br>
                                          <br>
                                          Around an open fire…<br>
                                           <br>
                                           H: When I was washing my hands, I had to like pause. When you wash your hands, is it ever like a trip?<br>
                                           J: How so?<br>
                                           H: Every time you wash your hands, it’s kind of like you come back from a trip almost. I like never wash my hands. But this time, I was like I got everything off my hands now.<br>
                                           N: It smells great, but I don’t know what I’m putting into my body. Gotta have my corn, dog! Living like dragons is all about going where the fire is. I always thought a good idea would be to have a restaurant where as a free appetizer they serve macadamia nut cookies, instead of bread. They kind of cleanse the palate, they’re salty, but sweet at the same time…<br>
                                           J: I feel like they’d be too heavy.<br>
                                           N: They’d be light. They’d probably be light.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The boys gather their sleeping bags to set them up in the tent.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             H: Remember when you were like “pick your poison”? That was so fucking cool. Because we got what we chose out of our own fucking journey. Oh, where are you going? So wake up tomorrow and leave?<br>
                                             J: I feel like when we wake up tomorrow we won’t want to leave. Do you want to eat Hudson?<br>
                                              <br>
                                              Hudson and Nick exit the tent after Joo.<br>
                                               <br>
                                               H: Remember when it snows dude, we’ll all be on Purple Mountain.<br>
                                               J: I don’t know what that means.<br>
                                               H: We’ll get our own mountain to climb. You’re at the end, and you look up, and its Purple Mountain. The tropical mountain.<br>
                                                <br>
                                                It starts to rain around the fire that they’ve built.<br>
                                                 <br>
                                                 H: You going to get those Cheerios? I’ll come with.<br>
                                                  <br>
                                                  The three head to the car.<br>
                                                   <br>
                                                   N: They are next to banana, shoes, and bowl. With some random ass white chocolate macadamia nuts floating around.<br>
                                                   H: This is such a fucking mess.<br>
                                                   N: We’ve collected so much stuff. Wire…Hudson’s dirty ass sock, my Dudefest shirt, banana…How do you juggle it if your mind’s over?<br>
                                                   J: This is ridiculous that we’re watching our fire from inside our car.<br>
                                                   N: But it’s raining. Aw, dude, its ferocious out there!<br>
                                                   J: It is.<br>
                                                   N: I’m so glad we did this.<br>
                                                    <br>
                                                    Their tent becomes unhinged from its stakes.<br>
                                                     <br>
                                                     N: Ah, so windy! So fucking windy!<br>
                                                     J: We didn’t stake it down at all.<br>
                                                     N: Eh, there’s some shit in there. It’s all good in the neighborhood! What you want? Hollywood?<br>
                                                     J: Did the fire go out?<br>
                                                     H: We came back to our campsite and our tent was literally upside down. We’re Team Dumbass. Holy shit.<br>
                                                     N: Fuck it.<br>
                                                     H: We’re just fucking retarded.<br>
                                                     N: Well, the tent’s still here.<br>
                                                     H: Exactly, it always fucking works out.<br>
                                                     J: You realize we’re not trapped here. We can find a hotel.<br>
                                                     N: We were just tripping on acid.<br>
                                                     J: Exactly.<br>
                                                     H: We can either adapt the car or sleep in the tent. I’m fucking sleeping in the tent, dude.<br>
                                                     J: I’m sleeping in the tent.<br>
                                                     H: We can’t sleep in here dude. It’s gonna get cold as shit in here.<br>
                                                     N: It’s going to get cold as shit in that tent. This is like the difference between why I wear pants when its cold out and you don’t.<br>
                                                     H: It’s going to be cold as fuck in that tent. Holy shit. It’s going to be so fucking cold in that tent. Oh my god-<br>
                                                     N: It’s not that cold yet.<br>
                                                     H: Yeah it’s not that cold. Is it going to be as cold as it was last last night?<br>
                                                     N: The last last night was pretty ridiculous.<br>
                                                     J: From what I remember, it’s not supposed to be as cold but it’s going to be snowing in the morning.<br>
                                                     H: Dry cold is not as bad as wet cold.<br>
                                                     N: Of course. But snow intensifies the stage for light.<br>
                                                     J: Well, it will be snowing on top of the mountains at least.<br>
                                                     H: I am fucking tripping on LSD right now?<br>
                                                     N: Is it today?<br>
                                                     (Car alarm goes off in the distance. )<br>
                                                     J: It’s not your car Hudson. That’s the important part.<br>
                                                     H: The first person to wake up at a logical time to wake up: Wake me the fuck up. Yeah, wake me the fuck up.<br>
                                                     J: The important thing is that I’m the only one with a clock here.<br>
                                                     H: Yeah, I’m probably just going to wake up when its light outside. Is it cool if I wake you guys up?<br>
                                                     N: Yeah, its cool. We can bust to Salt Lake and be there by like, 2?<br>
                                                     H: If it’s not really cold I’m going to fucking sleep. But I’m assuming it’s going to be really cold. But if it’s not that cold then I’m going to be passed out. But if it’s like daylight out and like cold as shit, then wake my ass up.<br>
                                                     J: So I guess we’ll wait for the fire to go out and then go to sleep?<br>
                                                     H: I could honestly get up at like 6 or 7. We slept for eleven hours last night. I’m not even like tired now, honestly.<br>
                                                     J: Well, I’m not tired either, but that’s part of the LSD talking too.<br>
                                                     H: We’re all just like assuming its going to be shitty out, but it could be like fucking sunny and we’d be like ok let’s grab something to eat and let’s go.<br>
